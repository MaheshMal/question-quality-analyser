"Get the empirical data for random values of n in a range of, say, between 102 and 104 or 105 and plot the data obtained. (You may want to use different scales for the axes of your coordinate system.)",Procedural,Procedural,Procedural,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural
Represent the disk movements by flipping bits in a binary n-tuple.,Metacognitive,Procedural,Conceptual,Conceptual,Conceptual,Factual
What structure does a complete tree of height h with the largest number of nodes have? What about a complete tree with the smallest number of nodes? b. Use the results established in part (a).,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual
Take advantage of the standard traversals of such trees.,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural
"Follow the definitions of the arrays B and C in the description of the method. b. Find, say, B[C[3]] for the example in part (a). ",Procedural,Procedural,Procedural,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural
Thinking about searching for information should lead to a variety of examples.,Conceptual,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual
Follow the insertion algorithm outlined in the section.,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual
Compare the definitions of the two techniques.,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Conceptual,Conceptual,Factual
Use a space-for-time trade-off.,Procedural,Procedural,Factual,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural
Check whether the proof of the algorithm's correctness is valid for negative edge weights.,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural
The answer is no. Give a counterexample.,Procedural,Factual,Conceptual,Conceptual,Conceptual,Procedural
"This is a straightforward question. You may assume that the three elements to be sorted are distinct. (If you need help, see decision trees for the threeelement selection sort and three-element insertion sort in the section.) ",Conceptual,Procedural,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural
This is not an easy task. None of the standard sorting algorithms can do this. Try to design a special algorithm that squeezes as much information as possible from each of its comparisons.,Procedural,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Conceptual,Procedural
This is a very straightforward question. Use the obvious observation that sequential search in a sorted list can be stopped as soon as an element larger than the search key is encountered.,Conceptual,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural
Use the definitions of the absolute and relative errors and the properties of the absolute value.,Procedural,Factual,Procedural,Conceptual,Conceptual,Procedural
Apply the formula for the area of a trapezoid to each of the n approximating trapezoid strips and sum them up.,Conceptual,Factual,Factual,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural
"Use the fact that |xn - x| is the distance between xn, the middle of interval [an, bn], and root x. ",Procedural,Factual,Conceptual,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural
