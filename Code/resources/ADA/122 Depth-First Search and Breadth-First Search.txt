the term exhaustive search can also be applied to two very important algorithms that systematically process all vertices and edges of a graph. these two traversal algorithms are depth first search dfs and breadth first search bfs . these algorithms have proved to be very useful for many applications involving graphs in artificial intelligence and operations research. in addition they are indispensable for efficient investigation of fundamental properties of graphs such as connectivity and cycle presence.
