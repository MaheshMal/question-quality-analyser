the data structure called the heap is definitely not a disordered pile of items as the word's definition in a standard dictionary might suggest. rather it is a clever partially ordered data structure that is especially suitable for implementing priority queues. recall that a priority queue is a multiset of items with an orderable characteristic called an item's priority with the following operations figure . illustration of the definition of heap only the leftmost tree is a heap. finding an item with the highest i.e. largest priority deleting an item with the highest priority adding a new item to the multiset it is primarily an efficient implementation of these operations that makes the heap both interesting and useful. priority queues arise naturally in such applications as scheduling job executions by computer operating systems and traffic management by communication networks. they also arise in several important algorithms e.g. prim's algorithm section . dijkstra's algorithm section . huffman encoding section . and branch and bound applications section . . the heap is also the data structure that serves as a cornerstone of a theoretically important sorting algorithm called heapsort. we discuss this algorithm after we define the heap and investigate its basic properties.
