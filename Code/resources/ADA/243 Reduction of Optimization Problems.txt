our next example deals with solving optimization problems. if a problem asks to find a maximum of some function it is said to be a maximization problem if it asks to find a function's minimum it is called a minimization problem. suppose now that you need to find a minimum of some function f x and you have an algorithm for function maximization. how can you take advantage of the latter? the answer lies in the simple formula min f x max f x . in other words to minimize a function we can maximize its negative instead and to get a correct minimal value of the function itself change the sign of the answer. this property is illustrated for a function of one real variable in figure . . of course the formula max f x min f x is valid as well it shows how a maximization problem can be reduced to an equivalent minimization problem. this relationship between minimization and maximization problems is very general it holds for functions defined on any domain d. in particular we can y f x f x x x f x f x figure . relationship between minimization and maximization problems min f x max f x . apply it to functions of several variables subject to additional constraints. a very important class of such problems is introduced below in this section. now that we are on the topic of function optimization it is worth pointing out that the standard calculus procedure for finding extremum points of a function is in fact also based on problem reduction. indeed it suggests finding the function's derivative f x and then solving the equation f x to find the function's critical points. in other words the optimization problem is reduced to the problem of solving an equation as the principal part of finding extremum points. note that we are not calling the calculus procedure an algorithm since it is not clearly defined. in fact there is no general method for solving equations. a little secret of calculus textbooks is that problems are carefully selected so that critical points can always be found without difficulty. this makes the lives of both students and instructors easier but in the process may unintentionally create a wrong impression in students' minds.
