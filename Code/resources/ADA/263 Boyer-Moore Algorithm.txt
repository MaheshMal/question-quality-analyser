now we outline the boyer moore algorithm itself. if the first comparison of the rightmost character in the pattern with the corresponding character c in the text fails the algorithm does exactly the same thing as horspool's algorithm. namely it shifts the pattern to the right by the number of characters retrieved from the table precomputed as explained earlier. the two algorithms act differently however after some positive number k k m of the pattern's characters are matched successfully before a mismatch is encountered s ... c si k ... si ... sn text p ... pm k pm k ... pm pattern in this situation the boyer moore algorithm determines the shift size by considering two quantities. the first one is guided by the text's character c that caused a mismatch with its counterpart in the pattern. accordingly it is called the badsymbol shift. the reasoning behind this shift is the reasoning we used in horspool's algorithm. if c is not in the pattern we shift the pattern to just pass this c in the text. conveniently the size of this shift can be computed by the formula t c k where t c is the entry in the precomputed table used by horspool's algorithm see above and k is the number of matched characters s ... c si k ... si ... sn text p ... pm k pm k ... pm pattern p ... pm for example if we search for the pattern barber in some text and match the last two characters before failing on letter s in the text we can shift the pattern by t s positions s ... s e r ... sn b a r b e r b a r b e r the same formula can also be used when the mismatching character c of the text occurs in the pattern provided t c k . for example if we search for the pattern barber in some text and match the last two characters before failing on letter a we can shift the pattern by t a positions s ... a e r ... sn b a r b e r b a r b e r if t c k we obviously do not want to shift the pattern by or a negative number of positions. rather we can fall back on the brute force thinking and simply shift the pattern by one position to the right. to summarize the bad symbol shift d is computed by the boyer moore algorithm either as t c k if this quantity is positive and as if it is negative or zero. this can be expressed by the following compact formula d max t c k . . the second type of shift is guided by a successful match of the last k characters of the pattern. we refer to the ending portion of the pattern as its suffix of size k and denote it suff k . accordingly we call this type of shift the good suffix shift. we now apply the reasoning that guided us in filling the bad symbol shift table which was based on a single alphabet character c to the pattern's suffixes of sizes . . . m to fill in the good suffix shift table. let us first consider the case when there is another occurrence of suff k in the pattern or to be more accurate there is another occurrence of suff k not preceded by the same character as in its rightmost occurrence. it would be useless to shift the pattern to match another occurrence of suff k preceded by the same character because this would simply repeat a failed trial. in this case we can shift the pattern by the distance d between such a second rightmost occurrence not preceded by the same character as in the rightmost occurrence of suff k and its rightmost occurrence. for example for the pattern abcbab these distances for k and will be and respectively k pattern d abcbab abcbab what is to be done if there is no other occurrence of suff k not preceded by the same character as in its rightmost occurrence? in most cases we can shift the pattern by its entire length m. for example for the pattern dbcbab and k we can shift the pattern by its entire length of characters s ... c b a b ... sn d b c b a b d b c b a b unfortunately shifting the pattern by its entire length when there is no other occurrence of suff k not preceded by the same character as in its rightmost occurrence is not always correct. for example for the pattern abcbab and k shifting by could miss a matching substring that starts with the text's ab aligned with the last two characters of the pattern s ... c b a b c b a b ... sn a b c b a b a b c b a b note that the shift by is correct for the pattern dbcbab but not for abcbab because the latter pattern has the same substring ab as its prefix beginning part of the pattern and as its suffix ending part of the pattern . to avoid such an erroneous shift based on a suffix of size k for which there is no other occurrence in the pattern not preceded by the same character as in its rightmost occurrence we need to find the longest prefix of size l k that matches the suffix of the same size l. if such a prefix exists the shift size d is computed as the distance between this prefix and the corresponding suffix otherwise d is set to the pattern's length m. as an example here is the complete list of the d values the good suffix table of the boyer moore algorithm for the pattern abcbab k pattern d abcbab abcbab abcbab abcbab abcbab now we are prepared to summarize the boyer moore algorithm in its entirety. the boyer moore algorithm step for a given pattern and the alphabet used in both the pattern and the text construct the bad symbol shift table as described earlier. step using the pattern construct the good suffix shift table as described earlier. step align the pattern against the beginning of the text. step repeat the following step until either a matching substring is found or the pattern reaches beyond the last character of the text. starting with the last character in the pattern compare the corresponding characters in the pattern and the text until either all m character pairs are matched then stop or a mismatching pair is encountered after k character pairs are matched successfully. in the latter case retrieve the entry t c from the c's column of the bad symbol table where c is the text's mismatched character. if k also retrieve the corresponding d entry from the good suffix table. shift the pattern to the right by the number of positions computed by the formula d d if k . max d d if k where d max t c k . shifting by the maximum of the two available shifts when k is quite logical. the two shifts are based on the observations the first one about a text's mismatched character and the second one about a matched group of the pattern's rightmost characters that imply that shifting by less than d and d characters respectively cannot lead to aligning the pattern with a matching substring in the text. since we are interested in shifting the pattern as far as possible without missing a possible matching substring we take the maximum of these two numbers. example as a complete example let us consider searching for the pattern baobab in a text made of english letters and spaces. the bad symbol table looks as follows c a b c d ... o ... z t c the good suffix table is filled as follows k pattern d baobab baobab baobab baobab baobab the actual search for this pattern in the text given in figure . proceeds as follows. after the last b of the pattern fails to match its counterpart k in the text the algorithm retrieves t k from the bad symbol table and shifts the pattern by d max t k positions to the right. the new try successfully matches two pairs of characters. after the failure of the third comparison on the space character in the text the algorithm retrieves t from the bad symbol table and d from the good suffix table to shift the pattern by max d d max . note that on this iteration it is the good suffix rule that leads to a farther shift of the pattern. the next try successfully matches just one pair of b's. after the failure of the next comparison on the space character in the text the algorithm retrieves t from the bad symbol table and d from the good suffix table to shift b e s s k n e w a b o u t b a o b a b s b a o b a b d t k b a o b a b d t b a o b a b d d t d max d d max b a o b a b figure . example of string matching with the boyer moore algorithm. the pattern by max d d max . note that on this iteration it is the bad symbol rule that leads to a farther shift of the pattern. the next try finds a matching substring in the text after successfully matching all six characters of the pattern with their counterparts in the text. when searching for the first occurrence of the pattern the worst case efficiency of the boyer moore algorithm is known to be linear. though this algorithm runs very fast especially on large alphabets relative to the length of the pattern many people prefer its simplified versions such as horspool's algorithm when dealing with natural language like strings. exercises . . apply horspool's algorithm to search for the pattern baobab in the
