let us start by reiterating an important point made in the introduction to this chapter we can consider algorithms to be procedural solutions to problems. these solutions are not answers but specific instructions for getting answers. it is this emphasis on precisely defined constructive procedures that makes computer science distinct from other disciplines. in particular this distinguishes it from theoretical mathematics whose practitioners are typically satisfied with just proving the existence of a solution to a problem and possibly investigating the solution's properties. we now list and briefly discuss a sequence of steps one typically goes through in designing and analyzing an algorithm figure . .
