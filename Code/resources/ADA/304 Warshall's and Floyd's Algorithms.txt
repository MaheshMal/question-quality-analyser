in this section we look at two well known algorithms warshall's algorithm for computing the transitive closure of a directed graph and floyd's algorithm for the all pairs shortest paths problem. these algorithms are based on essentially the same idea exploit a relationship between a problem and its simpler rather than smaller version. warshall and floyd published their algorithms without mentioning dynamic programming. nevertheless the algorithms certainly have a dynamic programming flavor and have come to be considered applications of this technique.
