once you completely understand a problem you need to ascertain the capabilities of the computational device the algorithm is intended for. the vast majority of understand the problem decide on computational means exact vs. approximate solving algorithm design technique design an algorithm prove correctness analyze the algorithm code the algorithm figure . algorithm design and analysis process. algorithms in use today are still destined to be programmed for a computer closely resembling the von neumann machine a computer architecture outlined by the prominent hungarian american mathematician john von neumann in collaboration with a. burks and h. goldstine in . the essence of this architecture is captured by the so called random access machine ram . its central assumption is that instructions are executed one after another one operation at a time. accordingly algorithms designed to be executed on such machines are called sequential algorithms. the central assumption of the ram model does not hold for some newer computers that can execute operations concurrently i.e. in parallel. algorithms that take advantage of this capability are called parallel algorithms. still studying the classic techniques for design and analysis of algorithms under the ram model remains the cornerstone of algorithmics for the foreseeable future. should you worry about the speed and amount of memory of a computer at your disposal? if you are designing an algorithm as a scientific exercise the answer is a qualified no. as you will see in section . most computer scientists prefer to study algorithms in terms independent of specification parameters for a particular computer. if you are designing an algorithm as a practical tool the answer may depend on a problem you need to solve. even the slow computers of today are almost unimaginably fast. consequently in many situations you need not worry about a computer being too slow for the task. there are important problems however that are very complex by their nature or have to process huge volumes of data or deal with applications where the time is critical. in such situations it is imperative to be aware of the speed and memory available on a particular computer system.
