you may recall from the introduction to this chapter that decrease by a constantfactor is the second major variety of decrease and conquer. as an example of an algorithm based on this technique we mentioned there exponentiation by squaring defined by formula . . in this section you will find a few other examples of such algorithms.. the most important and well known of them is binary search. decrease by a constant factor algorithms usually run in logarithmic time and being very efficient do not happen often a reduction by a factor other than two is especially rare.
