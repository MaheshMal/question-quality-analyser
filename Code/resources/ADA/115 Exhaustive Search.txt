many important problems require finding an element with a special property in a domain that grows exponentially or faster with an instance size. typically such problems arise in situations that involve explicitly or implicitly combinatorial objects such as permutations combinations and subsets of a given set. many such problems are optimization problems they ask to find an element that maximizes or minimizes some desired characteristic such as a path length or an assignment cost. exhaustive search is simply a brute force approach to combinatorial problems. it suggests generating each and every element of the problem domain selecting those of them that satisfy all the constraints and then finding a desired element e.g. the one that optimizes some objective function . note that although the idea of exhaustive search is quite straightforward its implementation typically requires an algorithm for generating certain combinatorial objects. we delay a discussion of such algorithms until the next chapter and assume here that they exist. we illustrate exhaustive search by applying it to three important problems the traveling salesman problem the knapsack problem and the assignment problem.
