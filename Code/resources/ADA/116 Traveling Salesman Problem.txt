the traveling salesman problem tsp has been intriguing researchers for the last years by its seemingly simple formulation important applications and interesting connections to other combinatorial problems. in layman's terms the problem asks to find the shortest tour through a given set of n cities that visits each city exactly once before returning to the city where it started. the problem can be conveniently modeled by a weighted graph with the graph's vertices representing the cities and the edge weights specifying the distances. then the problem can be stated as the problem of finding the shortest hamiltonian circuit of the graph. a hamiltonian circuit is defined as a cycle that passes through all the vertices of the graph exactly once. it is named after the irish mathematician sir william rowan hamilton who became interested in such cycles as an application of his algebraic discoveries. it is easy to see that a hamiltonian circuit can also be defined as a sequence of n adjacent vertices vi vi . . . vin vi where the first vertex of the sequence is the same as the last one and all the other n vertices are distinct. further we can assume with no loss of generality that all circuits start and end at one particular vertex they are cycles after all are they not? . thus we can get all the tours by generating all the permutations of n intermediate cities compute the tour lengths and find the shortest among them. figure . presents a small instance of the problem and its solution by this method. an inspection of figure . reveals three pairs of tours that differ only by their direction. hence we could cut the number of vertex permutations by half. we could for example choose any two intermediate vertices say b and c and then consider only permutations in which b precedes c. this trick implicitly defines a tour's direction. this improvement cannot brighten the efficiency picture much however. the total number of permutations needed is still n ! which makes the exhaustive search approach impractical for all but very small values of n. on the other hand if you always see your glass as half full you can claim that cutting the work by half is nothing to sneeze at even if you solve a small instance of the problem especially by hand. also note that had we not limited our investigation to the circuits starting at the same vertex the number of permutations would have been even larger by a factor of n.
