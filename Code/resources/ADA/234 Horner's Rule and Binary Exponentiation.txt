in this section we discuss the problem of computing the value of a polynomial p x anxn an xn . . . a x a . at a given point x and its important special case of computing xn. polynomials constitute the most important class of functions because they possess a wealth of good properties on the one hand and can be used for approximating other types of functions on the other. the problem of manipulating polynomials efficiently has been important for several centuries new discoveries were still being made the last years. by far the most important of them was the fast fourier transform fft . the practical importance of this remarkable algorithm which is based on representing a polynomial by its values at specially chosen points was such that some people consider it one of the most important algorithmic discoveries of all time. because of its relative complexity we do not discuss the fft algorithm in this book. an interested reader will find a wealth of literature on the subject including reasonably accessible treatments in such textbooks as kle and cor .
