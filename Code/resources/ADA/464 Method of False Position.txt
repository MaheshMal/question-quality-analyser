the method of false position also known by its name in latin regula falsi is to interpolation search as the bisection method is to binary search. like the bisection method it has on each iteration some interval an bn bracketing a root of a continuous function f x that has opposite sign values at an and bn. unlike the bisection method however it computes the next root approximation not as the middle of an bn but as the x intercept of the straight line through the points an f an and bn f bn figure . . you are asked in the exercises to show that the formula for this x intercept can be written as xn anf bn bnf an . . f bn f an example figure . contains the results of the first eight iterations of this method for solving equation . . although for this example the method of false position does not perform as well as the bisection method for many instances it yields a faster converging sequence.
