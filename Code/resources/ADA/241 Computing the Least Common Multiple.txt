recall that the least common multiple of two positive integers m and n denoted lcm m n is defined as the smallest integer that is divisible by both m and n. for example lcm and lcm . the least common multiple is one of the most important notions in elementary arithmetic and algebra. perhaps you remember the following middle school method for computing it given the prime factorizations of m and n compute the product of all the common prime factors of m and n all the prime factors of m that are not in n and all the prime factors of n that are not in m. for example . . . . . . lcm . . . . . as a computational procedure this algorithm has the same drawbacks as the middle school algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor discussed in section . it is inefficient and requires a list of consecutive primes. a much more efficient algorithm for computing the least common multiple can be devised by using problem reduction. after all there is a very efficient algorithm euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor which is a product of all the common prime factors of m and n. can we find a formula relating lcm m n and gcd m n ? it is not difficult to see that the product of lcm m n and gcd m n includes every factor of m and n exactly once and hence is simply equal to the product of m and n. this observation leads to the formula lcm m n m.n gcd m n where gcd m n can be computed very efficiently by euclid's algorithm.
