as pointed out in the previous section the efficiency analysis framework concentrates on the order of growth of an algorithm's basic operation count as the principal indicator of the algorithm's efficiency. to compare and rank such orders of growth computer scientists use three notations o big oh big omega and big theta . first we introduce these notations informally and then after several examples formal definitions are given. in the following discussion t n and g n can be any nonnegative functions defined on the set of natural numbers. in the context we are interested in t n will be an algorithm's running time usually indicated by its basic operation count c n and g n will be some simple function to compare the count with.
