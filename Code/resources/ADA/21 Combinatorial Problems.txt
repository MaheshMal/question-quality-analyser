from a more abstract perspective the traveling salesman problem and the graphcoloring problem are examples of combinatorial problems. these are problems that ask explicitly or implicitly to find a combinatorial object such as a permutation a combination or a subset that satisfies certain constraints. a desired combinatorial object may also be required to have some additional property such as a maximum value or a minimum cost. generally speaking combinatorial problems are the most difficult problems in computing from both a theoretical and practical standpoint. their difficulty stems from the following facts. first the number of combinatorial objects typically grows extremely fast with a problem's size reaching unimaginable magnitudes even for moderate sized instances. second there are no known algorithms for solving most such problems exactly in an acceptable amount of time. moreover most computer scientists believe that such algorithms do not exist. this conjecture has been neither proved nor disproved and it remains the most important unresolved issue in theoretical computer science. we discuss this topic in more detail in section . . some combinatorial problems can be solved by efficient algorithms but they should be considered fortunate exceptions to the rule. the shortest path problem mentioned earlier is among such exceptions.
