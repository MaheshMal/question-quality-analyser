gaussian elimination is a very useful algorithm that tackles one of the most important problems of applied mathematics solving systems of linear equations. in fact gaussian elimination can also be applied to several other problems of linear algebra such as computing a matrix inverse. the inverse of an n n matrix a is an n n matrix denoted a such that aa i where i is the n n identity matrix the matrix with all zero elements except the main diagonal elements which are all ones . not every square matrix has an inverse but when it exists the inverse is unique. if a matrix a does not have an inverse it is called singular. one can prove that a matrix is singular if and only if one of its rows is a linear combination a sum of some multiples of the other rows. a convenient way to check whether a matrix is nonsingular is to apply gaussian elimination if it yields an upper triangular matrix with no zeros on the main diagonal the matrix is nonsingular otherwise it is singular. so being singular is a very special situation and most square matrices do have their inverses. theoretically inverse matrices are very important because they play the role of reciprocals in matrix algebra overcoming the absence of the explicit division operation for matrices. for example in a complete analogy with a linear equation in one unknown ax b whose solution can be written as x a b if a is not zero we can express a solution to a system of n equations in n unknowns ax b as x a b if a is nonsingular where b is of course a vector not a number. according to the definition of the inverse matrix for a nonsingular n n matrix a to compute it we need to find n numbers xij i j n such that a a ... a n x x ... x n ... a... a ... a n x... x ... x n ... . ... an an ... ann xn xn ... xnn ... we can find the unknowns by solving n systems of linear equations that have the same coefficient matrix a the vector of unknowns xj is the j th column of the inverse and the right hand side vector ej is the j th column of the identity matrix j n axj ej . we can solve these systems by applying gaussian elimination to matrix a augmented by the n n identity matrix. better yet we can use forward elimination to find the lu decomposition of a and then solve the systems lu xj ej j . . . n as explained earlier.
