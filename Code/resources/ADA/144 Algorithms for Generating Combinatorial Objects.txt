in this section we keep our promise to discuss algorithms for generating combinatorial objects. the most important types of combinatorial objects are permutations combinations and subsets of a given set. they typically arise in problems that require a consideration of different choices. we already encountered them in chapter when we discussed exhaustive search. combinatorial objects are studied in a branch of discrete mathematics called combinatorics. mathematicians of course are primarily interested in different counting formulas we should be grateful for such formulas because they tell us how many items need to be generated. in particular they warn us that the number of combinatorial objects typically grows exponentially or even faster as a function of the problem size. but our primary interest here lies in algorithms for generating combinatorial objects not just in counting them.
