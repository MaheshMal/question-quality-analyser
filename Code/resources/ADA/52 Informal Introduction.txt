informally o g n is the set of all functions with a lower or same order of growth as g n to within a constant multiple as n goes to infinity . thus to give a few examples the following assertions are all true n o n n o n n n o n . indeed the first two functions are linear and hence have a lower order of growth than g n n while the last one is quadratic and hence has the same order of growth as n . on the other hand n o n . n o n n n o n . indeed the functions n and . n are both cubic and hence have a higher order of growth than n and so has the fourth degree polynomial n n . the second notation g n stands for the set of all functions with a higher or same order of growth as g n to within a constant multiple as n goes to infinity . for example n n n n n but n n . finally g n is the set of all functions that have the same order of growth as g n to within a constant multiple as n goes to infinity . thus every quadratic function an bn c with a is in n but so are among infinitely many others n sin n and n log n. can you explain why? hopefully this informal introduction has made you comfortable with the idea behind the three asymptotic notations. so now come the formal definitions.
