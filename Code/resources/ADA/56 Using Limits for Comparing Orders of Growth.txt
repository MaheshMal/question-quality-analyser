though the formal definitions of o and are indispensable for proving their abstract properties they are rarely used for comparing the orders of growth of two specific functions. a much more convenient method for doing so is based on computing the limit of the ratio of two functions in question. three principal cases may arise implies that t n has a smaller order of growth than g n t n lim c implies that t n has the same order of growth as g n n g n implies that t n has a larger order of growth than g n . note that the first two cases mean that t n o g n the last two mean that t n g n and the second case means that t n g n . the limit based approach is often more convenient than the one based on the definitions because it can take advantage of the powerful calculus techniques developed for computing limits such as l'ho pital's rule lim t n lim t n n g n n g n and stirling's formula n n n! n e for large values of n. here are three examples of using the limit based approach to comparing orders of growth of two functions. example compare the orders of growth of n n and n . this is one of the examples we used at the beginning of this section to illustrate the definitions. n n n n lim lim lim . n n n n n n since the limit is equal to a positive constant the functions have the same order of growth or symbolically n n n . example compare the orders of growth of log n and n. unlike example the answer here is not immediately obvious. log n log n log e lim lim lim n log e lim . n n n n n n n n since the limit is equal to zero log n has a smaller order of growth than n. since limn log n we can use the so called little oh notation log n o n . n unlike the big oh the little oh notation is rarely used in analysis of algorithms. . the fourth case in which such a limit does not exist rarely happens in the actual practice of analyzing algorithms. still this possibility makes the limit based approach to comparing orders of growth less general than the one based on the definitions of o and . example compare the orders of growth of n! and n. we discussed this informally in section . . taking advantage of stirling's formula we get n n n nn n lim n! lim e lim n lim n n . n n n n n nen n e thus though n grows very fast n!grows still faster. we can write symbolically that n! n note however that while the big omega notation does not preclude the possibility that n! and n have the same order of growth the limit computed here certainly does.
