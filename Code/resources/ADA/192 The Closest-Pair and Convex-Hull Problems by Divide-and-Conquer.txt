in section . we discussed the brute force approach to solving two classic problems of computational geometry the closest pair problem and the convex hull problem. we saw that the two dimensional versions of these problems can be solved by brute force algorithms in n and o n time respectively. in this section we discuss more sophisticated and asymptotically more efficient algorithms for these problems which are based on the divide and conquer technique.
