geometric algorithms deal with geometric objects such as points lines and polygons. the ancient greeks were very much interested in developing procedures they did not call them algorithms of course for solving a variety of geometric problems including problems of constructing simple geometric shapes triangles circles and so on with an unmarked ruler and a compass. then for about years intense interest in geometric algorithms disappeared to be resurrected in the age of computers no more rulers and compasses just bits bytes and good old human ingenuity. of course today people are interested in geometric algorithms with quite different applications in mind such as computer graphics robotics and tomography. we will discuss algorithms for only two classic problems of computational geometry the closest pair problem and the convex hull problem. the closest pair problem is self explanatory given n points in the plane find the closest pair among them. the convex hull problem asks to find the smallest convex polygon that would include all the points of a given set. if you are interested in other geometric algorithms you will find a wealth of material in such specialized monographs as deb oro and pre .
