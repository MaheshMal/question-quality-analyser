as our next example we consider the problem of counting paths between two vertices in a graph. it is not difficult to prove by mathematical induction that the number of different paths of length k from the ith vertex to the j th vertex of a graph undirected or directed equals the i j th element of ak where a is the adjacency matrix of the graph. therefore the problem of counting a graph's paths can be solved with an algorithm for computing an appropriate power of its adjacency matrix. note that the exponentiation algorithms we discussed before for computing powers of numbers are applicable to matrices as well. as a specific example consider the graph of figure . . its adjacency matrix a and its square a indicate the numbers of paths of length and respectively between the corresponding vertices of the graph. in particular there are three a b a b c d a b c d a a a b a b c c c d d d figure . a graph its adjacency matrix a and its square a . the elements of a and a indicate the numbers of paths of lengths and respectively. paths of length that start and end at vertex a a b a a c a and a d a but there is only one path of length from a to c a d c .
