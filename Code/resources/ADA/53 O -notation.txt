definition a function t n is said to be in o g n denoted t n o g n if t n is bounded above by some constant multiple of g n for all large n i.e. if there exist some positive constant c and some nonnegative integer n such that t n cg n for all n n . the definition is illustrated in figure . where for the sake of visual clarity n is extended to be a real number. as an example let us formally prove one of the assertions made in the introduction n o n . indeed n n n for all n n n . thus as values of the constants c and n required by the definition we can take and respectively. note that the definition gives us a lot of freedom in choosing specific values for constants c and n . for example we could also reason that n n n for all n n to complete the proof with c and n . cg n t n doesn't matter n n figure . big oh notation t n o g n . t n cg n doesn't matter n n figure . big omega notation t n g n . notation definition a function t n is said to be in g n denoted t n g n if t n is bounded below by some positive constant multiple of g n for all large n i.e. if there exist some positive constant c and some nonnegative integer n such that t n cg n for all n n . the definition is illustrated in figure . . here is an example of the formal proof that n n n n for all n i.e. we can select c and n . c g n t n c g n doesn't matter n n figure . big theta notation t n g n . notation definition a function t n is said to be in g n denoted t n g n if t n is bounded both above and below by some positive constant multiples of g n for all large n i.e. if there exist some positive constants c and c and some nonnegative integer n such that c g n t n c g n for all n n . the definition is illustrated in figure . . for example let us prove that n n n . first we prove the right inequality the upper bound n n n n n for all n . second we prove the left inequality the lower bound n n n n n n n for all n n . hence we can select c c and n .
