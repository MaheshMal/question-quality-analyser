in this section we consider the application of the brute force approach to the problem of sorting given a list of n orderable items e.g. numbers characters from some alphabet character strings rearrange them in nondecreasing order. as we mentioned in section . dozens of algorithms have been developed for solving this very important problem. you might have learned several of them in the past. if you have try to forget them for the time being and look at the problem afresh. now after your mind is unburdened of previous knowledge of sorting algorithms ask yourself a question what would be the most straightforward method for solving the sorting problem? reasonable people may disagree on the answer to this question. the two algorithms discussed here selection sort and bubble sort seem to be the two prime candidates.
