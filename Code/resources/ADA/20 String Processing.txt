in recent decades the rapid proliferation of applications dealing with nonnumerical data has intensified the interest of researchers and computing practitioners in string handling algorithms. a string is a sequence of characters from an alphabet. strings of particular interest are text strings which comprise letters numbers and special characters bit strings which comprise zeros and ones and gene sequences which can be modeled by strings of characters from the four character alphabet a c g t . it should be pointed out however that string processing algorithms have been important for computer science for a long time in conjunction with computer languages and compiling issues. one particular problem that of searching for a given word in a text has attracted special attention from researchers. they call it string matching. several algorithms that exploit the special nature of this type of searching have been invented. we introduce one very simple algorithm in chapter and discuss two algorithms based on a remarkable idea by r. boyer and j. moore in chapter .
