we have already encountered linear programming see section . the general problem of optimizing a linear function of several variables subject to a set of linear constraints maximize or minimize c x . . . cnxn subject to ai x . . . ainxn or or bi for i . . . m x . . . xn . . we mentioned there that many important practical problems can be modeled as instances of linear programming. two researchers l. v. kantorovich of the former soviet union and the dutch american t. c. koopmans were even awarded the nobel prize in for their contributions to linear programming theory and its applications to economics. apparently because there is no nobel prize in mathematics the royal swedish academy of sciences failed to honor the u.s. mathematician g. b. dantzig who is universally recognized as the father of linear programming in its modern form and the inventor of the simplex method the classic algorithm for solving such problems.
