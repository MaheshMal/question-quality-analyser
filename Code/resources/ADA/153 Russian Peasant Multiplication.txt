now we consider a nonorthodox algorithm for multiplying two positive integers called multiplication a la russe or the russian peasant method. let n and m be positive integers whose product we want to compute and let us measure the instance size by the value of n. now if n is even an instance of half the size has to deal with n and we have an obvious formula relating the solution to the problem's larger instance to the solution to the smaller one n . m n . m. if n is odd we need only a slight adjustment of this formula n . m n . m m. using these formulas and the trivial case of . m m to stop we can compute product n . m either recursively or iteratively. an example of computing . with this algorithm is given in figure . . note that all the extra addends shown in parentheses in figure . a are in the rows that have odd values in the first column. therefore we can find the product by simply adding all the elements in the m column that have an odd number in the n column figure . b . also note that the algorithm involves just the simple operations of halving doubling and adding a feature that might be attractive for example to those n m n m a b figure . computing . by the russian peasant method. who do not want to memorize the table of multiplications. it is this feature of the algorithm that most probably made it attractive to russian peasants who according to western visitors used it widely in the nineteenth century and for whom the method is named. in fact the method was known to egyptian mathematicians as early as b.c. cha p. . it also leads to very fast hardware implementation since doubling and halving of binary numbers can be performed using shifts which are among the most basic operations at the machine level.
