as our next example let us consider the problem of finding a hamiltonian circuit in the graph in figure . a. without loss of generality we can assume that if a hamiltonian circuit exists it starts at vertex a. accordingly we make vertex a the root of the state space a b a c f b d e e c f d e e d f c dead end dead end f d dead end a solution a b figure . a graph. b state space tree for finding a hamiltonian circuit. the numbers above the nodes of the tree indicate the order in which the nodes are generated. tree figure . b . the first component of our future solution if it exists is a first intermediate vertex of a hamiltonian circuit to be constructed. using the alphabet order to break the three way tie among the vertices adjacent to a we select vertex b. from b the algorithm proceeds to c then to d then to e and finally to f which proves to be a dead end. so the algorithm backtracks from f to e then to d and then to c which provides the first alternative for the algorithm to pursue. going from c to e eventually proves useless and the algorithm has to backtrack from e to c and then to b. from there it goes to the vertices f e c and d from which it can legitimately return to a yielding the hamiltonian circuit a b f e c d a. if we wanted to find another hamiltonian circuit we could continue this process by backtracking from the leaf of the solution found.
