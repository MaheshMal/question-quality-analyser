      [BERS96] provides a good technical discussion of the design issues involved in allo-
      cating applications to client and server and in middleware approaches; the book
      also discusses products and standardization efforts. [REAG00a] and [REAG00b]
      cover client/server computing and network design approaches for supporting client/
      server computing.
      A good overview of middleware technology and products is [BRIT04].
      [MENA05] provides a performance comparison of remote procedure calls and
      distributed message passing.
      Two worthwhile surveys of SOA are [BROW03] and [BIH06]. [CHER05] and
      [BIEB05] analyze the impact of migrating to a SOA. [HUTC08] discusses strategies
      for migrating to an SOA. [CARE08] looks at the role of data services in an SOA.
      [TANE85] is a survey of distributed operating systems that covers both dis-
      tributed process communication and distributed process management. [CHAN90]
      provides an overview of distributed message passing operating systems. [TAY90]
      is a survey of the approach taken by various operating systems in implementing
      remote procedure calls.
      A thorough treatment of clusters can be found in [BUYY99a] and [BUYY99b].
      The former has a good treatment of Beowulf, which is also nicely covered in
      [RIDG97]. A more detailed treatment of Beowulf is [STER99].Windows Cluster
      Server is described in [SHOR97]; [RAJA00] provides a more detailed treatment.
      [LAI06] provides a close examination of thin client architecture.
