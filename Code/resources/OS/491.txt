Summary

      With a tightly coupled multiprocessor, multiple processors have access to the same
      main memory. In this configuration, the scheduling structure is somewhat more
      complex. For example, a given process may be assigned to the same processor for

      its entire life or dispatched to any processor each time it enters the Running state.
      Performance studies suggest that the differences among various scheduling algo-
      rithms are less significant in a multiprocessor system.
      A real-time process or task is one that is executed in connection with some
      process or function or set of events external to the computer system and that must
      meet one or more deadlines to interact effectively and correctly with the external
      environment. A real-time operating system is one that is capable of managing real-
      time processes. In this context, the traditional criteria for a scheduling algorithm
      do not apply. Rather, the key factor is the meeting of deadlines. Algorithms that
      rely heavily on preemption and on reacting to relative deadlines are appropriate
      in this context.
