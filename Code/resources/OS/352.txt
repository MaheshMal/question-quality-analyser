     Because partitioning has been supplanted by virtual memory techniques, most OS
     books offer only cursory coverage. One of the more complete and interesting treat-
     ments is in [MILE92]. A thorough discussion of partitioning strategies is found in
     [KNUT97].
        The topics of linking and loading are covered in many books on program
     development, computer architecture, and operating systems. A particularly detailed
     treatment is [BECK97]. [CLAR98] also contains a good discussion. A thorough
     practical discussion of this topic, with numerous OS examples, is [LEVI00].
