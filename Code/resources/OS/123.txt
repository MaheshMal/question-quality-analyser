      [BRIN01] is an excellent collection of papers covering major advances in OS design
      over the years. [SWAI07] is a provocative and interesting short article on the future
      of operating systems.

     [MUKH96] provides a good discussion of OS design issues for SMPs.
     [CHAP97] contains five articles on recent design directions for multiprocessor
     operating systems. Worthwhile discussions of the principles of microkernel design
     are contained in [LIED95] and [LIED96]; the latter focuses on performance
     issues.
     [LI10] and [SMIT05] provide good treatments of virtual machines.
     An excellent treatment of UNIX internals, which provides a comparative
     analysis of a number of variants, is [VAHA96]. For UNIX SVR4, [GOOD94]
     provides a definitive treatment, with ample technical detail. For the popular open-
     source FreeBSD, [MCKU05] is highly recommended. [MCDO07] provides a good
     treatment of Solaris internals. Good treatments of Linux internals are [LOVE10]
     and [MAUE08].
     Although there are countless books on various versions of Windows, there
     is remarkably little material available on Windows internals. The book to read is
     [RUSS11].
