        I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my mind. Intense mental
        concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has passed.
        Each of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carère has blurred my
        recollection of Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem
        may be submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair
        French lady and the infamous Upwood.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
     ·  Discuss the principal requirements for memory management.
     ·  Understand the reason for memory partitioning and explain the  various
        techniques that are used.
     ·  Understand and explain the concept of paging.
     ·  Understand and explain the concept of segmentation.
     ·  Assess the relative advantages of paging and segmentation.
     ·  Summarize key security issues related to memory management.
     ·  Describe the concepts of loading and linking.
     In a uniprogramming system, main memory is divided into two parts: one part for
     the operating system (resident monitor, kernel) and one part for the program cur-
     rently being executed. In a multiprogramming system, the "user" part of memory
     must be further subdivided to accommodate multiple processes. The task of subdi-
     vision is carried out dynamically by the operating system and is known as memory
     management.
        Effective memory management is vital in a multiprogramming system. If only
     a few processes are in memory, then for much of the time all of the processes
     will be waiting for I/O and the processor will be idle. Thus memory needs to be
     allocated to ensure a reasonable supply of ready processes to consume available
     processor time.
        We begin with the requirements that memory management is intended to
     satisfy. Next, we discuss a variety of simple schemes that have been used for
     memory management
        Table 7.1 introduces some key terms for our discussion. A set of animations
     that illustrate concepts in this chapter is available online. Click on the rotating globe

Table 7.1  Memory Management Terms
Frame      A fixed-length block of main memory.
Page       A fixed-length block of data that resides in secondary memory (such as disk). A page of data may
           temporarily be copied into a frame of main memory.
Segment    A variable-length block of data that resides in secondary memory. An entire segment may tempo-
           rarily be copied into an available region of main memory (segmentation) or the segment may be
           divided into pages which can be individually copied into main memory (combined segmentation
           and paging).
