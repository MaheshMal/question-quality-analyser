Disk Cache

     In Section 1.6 and Appendix 1A, we summarized the principles of cache memory.
     The term cache memory is usually used to apply to a memory that is smaller and
     faster than main memory and that is interposed between main memory and the

processor. Such a cache memory reduces average memory access time by exploiting
the principle of locality.
The same principle can be applied to disk memory. Specifically, a disk cache
is a buffer in main memory for disk sectors. The cache contains a copy of some of
the sectors on the disk. When an I/O request is made for a particular sector, a check
is made to determine if the sector is in the disk cache. If so, the request is satisfied
via the cache. If not, the requested sector is read into the disk cache from the disk.
Because of the phenomenon of locality of reference, when a block of data is fetched
into the cache to satisfy a single I/O request, it is likely that there will be future
references to that same block.
Design Considerations
Several design issues are of interest. First, when an I/O request is satisfied from the
disk cache, the data in the disk cache must be delivered to the requesting process. This
can be done either by transferring the block of data within main memory from the disk
cache to memory assigned to the user process, or simply by using a shared memory
capability and passing a pointer to the appropriate slot in the disk cache. The latter
approach saves the time of a memory-to-memory transfer and also allows shared
access by other processes using the readers/writers model described in Chapter 5.
A second design issue has to do with the replacement strategy. When a new
sector is brought into the disk cache, one of the existing blocks must be replaced.
This is the identical problem presented in Chapter 8; there the requirement was
for a page replacement algorithm. A number of algorithms have been tried. The
most commonly used algorithm is least recently used (LRU): Replace that block
that has been in the cache longest with no reference to it. Logically, the cache
consists of a stack of blocks, with the most recently referenced block on the top
of the stack. When a block in the cache is referenced, it is moved from its exist-
ing position on the stack to the top of the stack. When a block is brought in from
secondary memory, remove the block that is on the bottom of the stack and push
the incoming block onto the top of the stack. Naturally, it is not necessary actually
to move these blocks around in main memory; a stack of pointers can be associ-
ated with the cache.
Another possibility is least frequently used (LFU): Replace that block in the
set that has experienced the fewest references. LFU could be implemented by asso-
ciating a counter with each block. When a block is brought in, it is assigned a count
of 1; with each reference to the block, its count is incremented by 1. When replace-
ment is required, the block with the smallest count is selected. Intuitively, it might
seem that LFU is more appropriate than LRU because LFU makes use of more
pertinent information about each block in the selection process.
A simple LFU algorithm has the following problem. It may be that certain
blocks are referenced relatively infrequently overall, but when they are referenced,
there are short intervals of repeated references due to locality, thus building up
high reference counts. After such an interval is over, the reference count may be
misleading and not reflect the probability that the block will soon be referenced
again. Thus, the effect of locality may actually cause the LFU algorithm to make
poor replacement choices.

         To overcome this difficulty with LFU, a technique known as frequency-based
     replacement is proposed in [ROBI90]. For clarity, let us first consider a simplified
     version, illustrated in Figure 11.9a. The blocks are logically organized in a stack, as
     with the LRU algorithm. A certain portion of the top part of the stack is designated
     the new section. When there is a cache hit, the referenced block is moved to the top
     of the stack. If the block was already in the new section, its reference count is not
     incremented; otherwise it is incremented by 1. Given a sufficiently large new sec-
     tion, this results in the reference counts for blocks that are repeatedly re-referenced
     within a short interval remaining unchanged. On a miss, the block with the smallest
     reference count that is not in the new section is chosen for replacement; the least
     recently used such block is chosen in the event of a tie.
         The authors report that this strategy achieved only slight improvement over
     LRU. The problem is the following:
     1.  On a cache miss, a new block is brought into the new section, with a count of 1.
     2.  The count remains at 1 as long as the block remains in the new section.
     3.  Eventually the block ages out of the new section, with its count still at 1.
     4.  If the block is not now re-referenced fairly quickly, it is very likely to be
         replaced because it necessarily has the smallest reference count of those blocks
         that are not in the new section. In other words, there does not seem to be a
         sufficiently long interval for blocks aging out of the new section to build up
         their reference counts even if they were relatively frequently referenced.
         A further refinement addresses this problem: Divide the stack into three
     sections: new, middle, and old (Figure 11.9b). As before, reference counts are not
     incremented on blocks in the new section. However, only blocks in the old section
     are eligible for replacement. Assuming a sufficiently large middle section, this allows
                      New section                                 Old section
         MRU                                                                   LRU
                      Re-reference;
                      count unchanged      Re-reference;
                                           count : count 1
              Miss (new block brought in)
                      count : 1

                          relatively frequently referenced blocks a chance to build up their reference counts
                          before becoming eligible for replacement. Simulation studies by the authors indicate
                          that this refined policy is significantly better than simple LRU or LFU.
                                 Regardless of the particular replacement strategy, the replacement can take
                          place on demand or preplanned. In the former case, a sector is replaced only when
                          the slot is needed. In the latter case, a number of slots are released at a time. The
                          reason for this latter approach is related to the need to write back sectors. If a sector
                          is brought into the cache and only read, then when it is replaced, it is not necessary
                          to write it back out to the disk. However, if the sector has been updated, then it is
                          necessary to write it back out before replacing it. In this latter case, it makes sense
                          to cluster the writing and to order the writing to minimize seek time.
                          Performance Considerations
                          The same performance considerations discussed in Appendix 1A apply here. The
                          issue of cache performance reduces itself to a question of whether a given miss ratio
                          can be achieved. This will depend on the locality behavior of the disk references,
                          the replacement algorithm, and other design factors. Principally, however, the miss
                          ratio is a function of the size of the disk cache. Figure 11.10 summarizes results from
                          several studies using LRU, one for a UNIX system running on a VAX [OUST85]
                          and one for IBM mainframe operating systems [SMIT85]. Figure 11.11 shows results
                          for simulation studies of the frequency-based replacement algorithm. A comparison
                          of the two figures points out one of the risks of this sort of performance assessment.

                               The figures appear to show that LRU outperforms the frequency-based replace-
                               ment algorithm. However, when identical reference patterns using the same cache
                               structure are compared, the frequency-based replacement algorithm is superior.
                               Thus, the exact sequence of reference patterns, plus related design issues such as
                               block size, will have a profound influence on the performance achieved.
