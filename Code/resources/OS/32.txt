Evolution of the Microprocessor

     The hardware revolution that brought about desktop and handheld computing was
     the invention of the microprocessor, which contained a processor on a single chip.
     Though originally much slower than multichip processors, microprocessors have
     continually evolved to the point that they are now much faster for most computa-
     tions due to the physics involved in moving information around in sub-nanosecond
     timeframes.
     Not only have microprocessors become the fastest general purpose processors
     available, they are now multiprocessors; each chip (called a socket) contains multi-
     ple processors (called cores), each with multiple levels of large memory caches, and
     multiple logical processors sharing the execution units of each core. As of 2010, it is
     not unusual for even a laptop to have 2 or 4 cores, each with 2 hardware threads, for
     a total of 4 or 8 logical processors.
     Although processors provide very good performance for most forms of
     computing, there is increasing demand for numerical computation. Graphical
     Processing Units (GPUs) provide efficient computation on arrays of data using
     Single-Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) techniques pioneered in supercomput-
     ers. GPUs are no longer used just for rendering advanced graphics, but they are
     also used for general numerical processing, such as physics simulations for games
     or computations on large spreadsheets. Simultaneously, the CPUs themselves are
     gaining the capability of operating on arrays of data--with increasingly power-
     ful vector units integrated into the processor architecture of the x86 and AMD64
     families.
     Processors and GPUs are not the end of the computational story for the
     modern PC. Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are also present, for dealing with
     streaming signals--such as audio or video. DSPs used to be embedded in I/O
     devices, like modems, but they are now becoming first-class computational devices,
     especially in handhelds. Other specialized computational devices (fixed function
     units) co-exist with the CPU to support other standard computations, such as
     encoding/decoding speech and video (codecs), or providing support for encryption
     and security.
     To satisfy the requirements of handheld devices, the classic microprocessor
     is giving way to the System on a Chip (SoC), where not just the CPUs and caches
     are on the same chip, but also many of the other components of the system, such as
     DSPs, GPUs, I/O devices (such as radios and codecs), and main memory.
