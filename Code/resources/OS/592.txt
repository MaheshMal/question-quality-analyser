     There are a number of good books on file structures and file management. The
     following all focus on file management systems but also address related OS issues.
     Perhaps the most useful is [WIED87], which takes a quantitative approach to file
     management and deals with all of the issues raised in Figure 12.2, from disk schedul-
     ing to file structure. [VENU09] presents an object-oriented design approach toward
     file structure implementation. [LIVA90] emphasizes file structures, providing a
     good and lengthy survey with comparative performance analyses. [GROS86] pro-
     vides a balanced look at issues relating to both file I/O and file access methods. It
     also contains general descriptions of all of the control structures needed by a file
     system. These provide a useful checklist in assessing a file system design. [FOLK98]
     emphasizes the processing of files, addressing such issues as maintenance, searching
     and sorting, and sharing.
       [COME79] provides a thorough discussion of B-trees. [CORM09] and
     [KNUT98] also include good treatments.
       The Linux file system is examined in detail in [LOVE10] and [BOVE06]. A
     good overview is [RUBI97].
       [CUST94] provides a good overview of the NT file system. [NAGA97] covers
     the material in more detail.
