     As might be expected, virtual memory receives good coverage in most books on
     operating systems. [MILE92] provides a good summary of various research areas.
     [CARR84] provides an excellent in-depth examination of performance issues. The
     classic paper [DENN70] is still well worth a read. [DOWD93] provides an instruc-
     tive performance analysis of various page replacement algorithms. [JACO98a] is a
     good survey of issues in virtual memory design; it includes a discussion of inverted
     page tables. [JACO98b] looks at virtual memory hardware organizations in various
     microprocessors.
        It is a sobering experience to read [IBM86], which gives a detailed account of
     the tools and options available to a site manager in optimizing the virtual memory
     policies of MVS. The document illustrates the complexity of the problem.
        [VAHA96] is one of the best treatments of the memory management schemes
     used in the various flavors of UNIX. [GORM04] is a thorough treatment of Linux
     memory management.
