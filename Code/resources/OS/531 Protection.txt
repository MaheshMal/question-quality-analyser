 refers to a mechanism for controlling the access of programs processes or users to the resources defined by a computer system. this mechanism must provide a means for specifying the controls to be imposed together with a means of enforcement. we distinguish between protection and security which is a measure of confidence that the integrity of a system and its data will be preserved. security assurance is a much broader topic than is protection and we address it in chapter . objectives discuss the goals and principles of protection in a modern computer system. explain how protection domains combined with an access matrix are used to specify the resources a process may access. examine capability and language based protection systems.
