     General discussions of computer I/O can be found in most books on computer archi-
     tecture, such as [STAL10]. [MEE96a] provides a good survey of the underlying
     recording technology of disk and tape systems. [MEE96b] focuses on the data stor-
     age techniques for disk and tape systems. [WIED87] contains an excellent discussion
     of disk performance issues, including those relating to disk scheduling. [NG98] looks
     at disk hardware performance issues. [CAO96] analyzes disk caching and disk sched-
     uling. Good surveys of disk scheduling algorithms, with a performance analysis, are
     [WORT94] and [SELT90].
       [PAI00] is an instructive description of an integrated operating-system scheme
     for I/O buffering and caching.
       [DELL00] provides a detailed discussion of Windows NT device drivers plus a
     good overview of the entire Windows I/O architecture.
       An excellent survey of RAID technology, written by the inventors of the
     RAID concept, is [CHEN94]. [CHEN96] analyzes RAID performance. Another
     good paper is [FRIE96]. [DALT96] describes the Windows NT software RAID
     facility in detail. [LEVE10] examines the need to move beyond RAID 6 to a triple-
     parity configuration. [STAI10] is a good survey of the standard RAID levels plus a
     number of common RAID enhancements.
