 our coverage of operating system issues thus far has focused mainly on general purpose computing systems for example desktop and server systems . in this chapter we turn our attention to real time computing systems. the requirements of real time systems differ from those of many of the systems we have described largely because real time systems must produce results within certain deadlines. in this chapter we provide an overview of realtime computer systems and describe how real time operating systems must be constructed to meet the stringent timing requirements of these systems. objectives to explain the timing requirements of real time systems. to distinguish between hard and soft real time systems. to discuss the defining characteristics of real time systems to describe scheduling algorithms for hard real time systems
