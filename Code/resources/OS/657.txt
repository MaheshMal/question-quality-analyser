Recommended Reading and Web Sites

        The topics in this chapter are covered in more detail in [STAL08]. It is useful to
        read some of the classic tutorial papers on computer security; these provide a his-
        torical perspective from which to appreciate current work and thinking. The papers
        to read are [WARE79], [BROW72], [SALT75], [SHAN77], and [SUMM84]. Two
        more recent short treatments of computer security are [ANDR04] and [LAMP04].
        [NIST95] is an exhaustive (290 pages) treatment of the subject. Another good treat-
        ment is [NRC91]. Also useful is [FRAS97].

           dards and Technology (NIST). Contains a broad range of information on security
           threats, technology, and standards.
        ·  CERT Coordination Center: The organization that grew from the computer emergency
           response team formed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Site provides
           good information on Internet security threats, vulnerabilities, and attack statistics.
