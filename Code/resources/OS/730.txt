Summary

     Client/server computing is the key to realizing the potential of information systems
     and networks to improve productivity significantly in organizations. With client/
     server computing, applications are distributed to users on single-user workstations
     and personal computers. At the same time, resources that can and should be shared
     are maintained on server systems that are available to all clients. Thus, the client/
     server architecture is a blend of decentralized and centralized computing.
        Typically, the client system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that
     enables a user to exploit a variety of applications with minimal training and relative
     ease. Servers support shared utilities, such as database management systems. The
     actual application is divided between client and server in a way intended to optimize
     ease of use and performance.
        The key mechanism required in any distributed system is interprocess com-
     munication. Two techniques are in common use. A message-passing facility gener-
     alizes the use of messages within a single system. The same sorts of conventions and
     synchronization rules apply. Another approach is the use of the remote procedure
     call. This is a technique by which two programs on different machines interact using
     procedure call/return syntax and semantics. Both the called and calling program
     behave as if the partner program were running on the same machine.

      A cluster is a group of interconnected, whole computers working together as
      a unified computing resource that can create the illusion of being one machine. The
      term whole computer means a system that can run on its own, apart from the cluster.
