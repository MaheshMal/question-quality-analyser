     [STAL10] covers the topics of this chapter in detail. In addition, there are many other
     texts on computer organization and architecture. Among the more worthwhile texts
     are the following. [PATT09] is a comprehensive survey; [HENN07], by the same
     authors, is a more advanced text that emphasizes quantitative aspects of design.
        [DENN05] looks at the history of the development and application of the
     locality principle, making for fascinating reading.
