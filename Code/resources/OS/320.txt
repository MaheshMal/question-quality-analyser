     The classic paper on deadlocks, [HOLT72], is still well worth a read, as is [COFF71].
     Another good survey is [ISLO80]. [CORB96] is a thorough treatment of deadlock
     detection. [DIMI98] is a nice overview of deadlocks. Two papers by Levine [LEVI03a,
     LEVI03b] clarify some of the concepts used in discussions of deadlock. [SHUB03] is
     a useful overview of deadlock. [ABRA06] describes a deadlock detection package.
     The concurrency mechanisms in UNIX SVR4, Linux, and Solaris 2 are well covered
     in [GRAY97], [LOVE10], and [MCDO07], respectively. [HALL10] is a thorough treat-
     ment of UNIX concurrency and interprocess communication mechanisms.
