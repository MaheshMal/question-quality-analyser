Modern UNIX Systems

     As UNIX evolved, the number of different implementations proliferated, each pro-
     viding some useful features. There was a need to produce a new implementation that
     unified many of the important innovations, added other modern OS design features,
     and produced a more modular architecture. Typical of the modern UNIX kernel is
     the architecture depicted in Figure 2.18. There is a small core of facilities, written in

processes. Each of the outer circles represents functions and an interface that may
be implemented in a variety of ways.
             We now turn to some examples of modern UNIX systems.
System V Release 4 (SVR4)
SVR4, developed jointly by AT&T and Sun Microsystems, combines features from
SVR3, 4.3BSD, Microsoft Xenix System V, and SunOS. It was almost a total rewrite
of the System V kernel and produced a clean, if complex, implementation. New fea-
tures in the release include real-time processing support, process scheduling classes,
dynamically allocated data structures, virtual memory management, virtual file sys-
tem, and a preemptive kernel.
             SVR4 draws on the efforts of both commercial and academic designers and
was developed to provide a uniform platform for commercial UNIX deployment. It
has succeeded in this objective and is perhaps the most important UNIX variant. It
incorporates most of the important features ever developed on any UNIX system

    and does so in an integrated, commercially viable fashion. SVR4 runs on processors
    ranging from 32-bit microprocessors up to supercomputers.
    BSD
    The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) series of UNIX releases have played
    a key role in the development of OS design theory. 4.xBSD is widely used in aca-
    demic installations and has served as the basis of a number of commercial UNIX
    products. It is probably safe to say that BSD is responsible for much of the popular-
    ity of UNIX and that most enhancements to UNIX first appeared in BSD versions.
         4.4BSD was the final version of BSD to be released by Berkeley, with the
    design and implementation organization subsequently dissolved. It is a major
    upgrade to 4.3BSD and includes a new virtual memory system, changes in the ker-
    nel structure, and a long list of other feature enhancements.
         One of the most widely used and best documented versions of BSD is
    FreeBSD. FreeBSD is popular for Internet-based servers and firewalls and is used
    in a number of embedded systems.
         The latest version of the Macintosh OS, Mac OS X, is based on FreeBSD 5.0
    and the Mach 3.0 microkernel.
    Solaris 10
    Solaris is Sun's SVR4-based UNIX release, with the latest version being 10. Solaris
    provides all of the features of SVR4 plus a number of more advanced features, such
    as a fully preemptable, multithreaded kernel, full support for SMP, and an object-
    oriented interface to file systems. Solaris is the most widely used and most successful
    commercial UNIX implementation.
