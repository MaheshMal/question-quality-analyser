     [LEWI96] and [KLEI96] provide good overviews of thread concepts and a discus-
     sion of programming strategies; the former focuses more on concepts and the latter
     more on programming, but both provide useful coverage of both topics. [PHAM96]
     discusses the Windows NT thread facility in depth. Good coverage of UNIX threads
     concepts is found in [ROBB04].
