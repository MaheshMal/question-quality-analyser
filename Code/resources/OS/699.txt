         The reader who has persevered thus far in this account will realize the
         difficulties that were coped with, the hazards that were encountered,
         the mistakes that were made, and the work that was done.

      LEARNING OBJECTIVES
      After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
      ·  Present a summary of the key aspects of client/server computing.
      ·  Define service-oriented architecture.
      ·  Understand the principle design issues for distributed message passing.
      ·  Understand the principle design issues for remote procedure calls.
      ·  Understand the principle design issues for clusters.
      ·  Describe the cluster mechanisms in Windows 7 and Beowulf.
      In this chapter, we begin with an examination of some of the key concepts in distributed
      software, including client/server architecture, message passing, and remote procedure
      calls. Then we examine the increasingly important cluster architecture.
         Chapters 17 and 18 complete our discussion of distributed systems.
