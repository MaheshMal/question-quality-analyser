RAID

     As discussed earlier, the rate in improvement in secondary storage performance
     has been considerably less than the rate for processors and main memory. This
     mismatch has made the disk storage system perhaps the main focus of concern in
     improving overall computer system performance.
         As in other areas of computer performance, disk storage designers recognize
     that if one component can only be pushed so far, additional gains in performance
     are to be had by using multiple parallel components. In the case of disk storage,
     this leads to the development of arrays of disks that operate independently and
     in parallel. With multiple disks, separate I/O requests can be handled in parallel,
     as long as the data required reside on separate disks. Further, a single I/O request
     can be executed in parallel if the block of data to be accessed is distributed across
     multiple disks.
         With the use of multiple disks, there is a wide variety of ways in which the data
     can be organized and in which redundancy can be added to improve reliability. This
     could make it difficult to develop database schemes that are usable on a number of
     platforms and operating systems. Fortunately, industry has agreed on a standard-
     ized scheme for multiple-disk database design, known as
