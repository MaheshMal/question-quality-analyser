Basic Elements

        At a top level, a computer consists of processor, memory, and I/O components, with
        one or more modules of each type. These components are interconnected in some
        fashion to achieve the main function of the computer, which is to execute programs.
        Thus, there are four main structural elements:
           路  Processor: Controls the operation of the computer and performs its data pro-
              cessing functions. When there is only one processor, it is often referred to as
              the central processing unit (CPU).

路  Main memory: Stores data and programs. This memory is typically volatile; that
   is, when the computer is shut down, the contents of the memory are lost. In
   contrast, the contents of disk memory are retained even when the computer
   system is shut down. Main memory is also referred to as real memory or primary
   memory.
路  I/O modules: Move data between the computer and its external environment.
   The external environment consists of a variety of devices, including secondary
   memory devices (e.g., disks), communications equipment, and terminals.
路  System bus: Provides for communication among processors, main memory,
   and I/O modules.
   Figure 1.1 depicts these top-level components. One of the processor's func-
tions is to exchange data with memory. For this purpose, it typically makes use of
two internal (to the processor) registers: a memory address register (MAR), which
specifies the address in memory for the next read or write; and a memory buffer reg-
ister (MBR), which contains the data to be written into memory or which receives

     the data read from memory. Similarly, an I/O address register (I/OAR) specifies a
     particular I/O device. An I/O buffer register (I/OBR) is used for the exchange of
     data between an I/O module and the processor.
     A memory module consists of a set of locations, defined by sequentially num-
     bered addresses. Each location contains a bit pattern that can be interpreted as
     either an instruction or data. An I/O module transfers data from external devices to
     processor and memory, and vice versa. It contains internal buffers for temporarily
     holding data until they can be sent on.
