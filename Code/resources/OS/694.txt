     The topics in this chapter are covered in more detail in [STAL08].
         [OGOR03] is the paper to read for an authoritative survey of user authenti-
     cation. [BURR04] is also a worthwhile survey. [SAND94] is an excellent overview
     of access control. [SAND96] is a comprehensive overview of RBAC. [SAUN01]
     compares RBAC and DAC. [SCAR07] is a detailed and worthwhile treatment

of intrusion detection. Two short but useful survey articles on the subject are
[KENT00] and [MCHU00]. [NING04] surveys recent advances in intrusion
detection techniques. Good overview articles on antivirus approaches and mal-
ware defense generally are [CASS01], [FORR97], [KEPH97a], and [NACH97].
[LHEE03] surveys a range of alternative buffer overflow techniques, including a
number not mentioned in this chapter, along with possible defensive techniques.
The original published description of buffer overflow attacks is given in [LEVY96].
[KUPE05] is a good overview.
