 frequently a guiding principle can be used throughout a project such as the design of an operating system. following this principle simplifies design decisions and keeps the system consistent and easy to understand. a key time tested guiding principle for protection is the principle of least privilege. it dictates that programs users and even systems be given just enough privileges to perform their tasks. consider the analogy of a security guard with a passkey. if this key allows the guard into just the public areas that she guards then misuse of the key will result in minimal damage. if however the passkey allows access to all areas then damage from its being lost stolen misused copied or otherwise compromised will be much greater. an operating system following the principle of least privilege implements its features programs system calls and data structures so that failure or compromise of a component does the minimum damage and allows the minimum damage to be done. the overflow of a buffer in a system daemon might cause the daemon to fail for example but should not allow the execution of code from the process's stack that would enable a remote user to gain
