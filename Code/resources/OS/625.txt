      [KOOP96] provides a systematic discussion of the requirements for embedded
      systems. [STAN96] is a useful overview of real-time and embedded systems.
         [MASS03] and [ECOS07] both provide a detailed description of eCos internals.
      [THOM01] provides a brief overview with some code examples from the kernel.
      [LARM05] gives a more detailed description of the eCos configuration process.
         [HILL00] gives an overview and design rationale for TinyOS. [GAY05] is an
      interesting discussion of software design strategies using TinyOS. [BUON01] provides
      a good example of the use of TinyOS in building a network or wireless sensors. Two
      excellent references for the current version of TinyOS are [GAY03] and [LEVI05].
