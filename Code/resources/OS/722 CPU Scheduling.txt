 in chapter which covered real time systems we distinguished between soft real time systems and hard real time systems. soft real time systems simply give scheduling priority to critical processes. a soft real time system ensures that a critical process will be given preference over a noncritical process but provides no guarantee as to when the critical process will be scheduled. a typical requirement of continuous media however is that data must be delivered to a client by a certain deadline data that do not arrive by the deadline are unusable. multimedia systems thus require hard real time scheduling to ensure that a critical task will be serviced within a guaranteed period of time. another scheduling issue concerns whether a scheduling algorithm uses static priority or dynamic priority a distinction we first discussed in chapter . the difference between the two is that the priority of a process will remain unchanged if the scheduler assigns it a static priority. scheduling algorithms
