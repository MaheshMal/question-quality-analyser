 an operating system provides the environment within which programs are executed. internally operating systems vary greatly in their makeup since they are organized along many different lines. the design of a new operating system is a major task. it is important that the goals of the system be well defined before the design begins. these goals form the basis for choices among various algorithms and strategies. we can view an operating system from several vantage points. one view focuses on the services that the system provides another on the interface that it makes available to users and programmers a third on its components and their interconnections. in this chapter we explore all three aspects of operating systems showing the viewpoints of users programmers and operating system designers. we consider what services an operating system provides how they are provided and what the various methodologies are for designing such systems. finally we describe how operating systems are created and how a computer starts its operating system. objectives to describe the services an operating system provides to users processes and other systems. to discuss the various ways of structuring an operating system. to explain how operating systems are installed and customized and how they boot
