      [WEND89] is an interesting discussion of approaches to multiprocessor scheduling.
      A good treatment of real-time scheduling is contained in [LIU00]. The following
      collections of papers all contain important articles on real-time operating systems
      and scheduling: [KRIS94], [STAN93], [LEE93], and [TILB91]. [SHA90] provides
      a good explanation of priority inversion, priority inheritance, and priority ceiling.
      [ZEAD97] analyzes the performance of the SVR4 real-time scheduler. [LIND04]
      provides an overview of the Linux 2.6 scheduler; [LOVE10] contains a more
      detailed discussion.
