 an operating system is a program that manages the computer hardware. it also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware. an amazing aspect of operating systems is how varied they are in accomplishing these tasks. mainframe operating systems are designed primarily to optimize utilization of hardware. personal computer pc operating systems support complex games business applications and everything in between. operating systems for handheld computers are designed to provide an environment in which a user can easily interface with the computer to execute programs. thus some operatingsystems aredesigned tobeconvenient others tobeefficient andothers some combination of the two. before we can explore the details of computer system operation we need to know something about system structure. we begin by discussing the basic functions of system startup i o and storage. we also describe the basic computer architecture that makes it possible to write a functional operating system. because an operating system is large and complex it must be created piece by piece. each of these pieces should be a well delineated portion of the system with carefully defined inputs outputs and functions. in this chapter we provide a general overview of the major components of an operating system. objectives to provide a grand tour of the major operating systems components. to provide coverage of basic computer system organization
