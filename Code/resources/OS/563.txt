Record Blocking

      As indicated in Figure 12.2, records are the logical unit of access of a structured file,3
      whereas blocks are the unit of I/O with secondary storage. For I/O to be performed,
      records must be organized as blocks.
         There are several issues to consider. First, should blocks be of fixed or vari-
      able length? On most systems, blocks are of fixed length. This simplifies I/O, buffer
      allocation in main memory, and the organization of blocks on secondary storage.
      Second, what should the relative size of a block be compared to the average record
      size? The trade-off is this: The larger the block, the more records that are passed
      in one I/O operation. If a file is being processed or searched sequentially, this is an
      advantage, because the number of I/O operations is reduced by using larger blocks,
      thus speeding up processing. On the other hand, if records are being accessed ran-
      domly and no particular locality of reference is observed, then larger blocks result in
      the unnecessary transfer of unused records. However, combining the frequency of
      sequential operations with the potential for locality of reference, we can say that the
      I/O transfer time is reduced by using larger blocks. The competing concern is that
      larger blocks require larger I/O buffers, making buffer management more difficult.
         Given the size of a block, there are three methods of blocking that can be used:
      ·  Fixed blocking: Fixed-length records are used, and an integral number of
         records are stored in a block. There may be unused space at the end of each
         block. This is referred to as internal fragmentation.
      ·  Variable-length spanned blocking: Variable-length records are used and are
         packed into blocks with no unused space. Thus, some records must span two
         blocks, with the continuation indicated by a pointer to the successor block.
      3As opposed to a file that is treated only as a stream of bytes, such as in the UNIX file system.

     ·  Variable-length unspanned blocking: Variable-length records are used, but
        spanning is not employed. There is wasted space in most blocks because of the
        inability to use the remainder of a block if the next record is larger than the
        remaining unused space.
        Figure 12.8 illustrates these methods assuming that a file is stored in sequen-
     tial blocks on a disk. The figure assumes that the file is large enough to span two
     tracks.4 The effect would not be changed if some other file allocation scheme were
     used (see Section 12.6).
        Fixed blocking is the common mode for sequential files with fixed-length
     records. Variable-length spanned blocking is efficient of storage and does not limit

      the size of records. However, this technique is difficult to implement. Records that
      span two blocks require two I/O operations, and files are difficult to update, regard-
      less of the organization. Variable-length unspanned blocking results in wasted space
      and limits record size to the size of a block.
          The record-blocking technique may interact with the virtual memory hard-
      ware, if such is employed. In a virtual memory environment, it is desirable to make
      the page the basic unit of transfer. Pages are generally quite small, so that it is
      impractical to treat a page as a block for unspanned blocking. Accordingly, some
      systems combine multiple pages to create a larger block for file I/O purposes. This
      approach is used for VSAM files on IBM mainframes.
