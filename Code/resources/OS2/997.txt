SECURITY IN WINDOWS 8
     NT was originally designed to meet the U.S. Department of Defense's C2 se-

systems must meet. This standard requires operating systems to have certain prop-

Although Windows was not specifically designed for C2 compliance, it inherits
many security properties from the original security design of NT, including the fol-

       1.  Secure login with antispoofing measures.
       2.  Discretionary access controls.

name and password are then written to disk and the user is told that login has
