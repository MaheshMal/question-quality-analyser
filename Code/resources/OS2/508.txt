TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 HYPERVISORS
     Goldberg (1972) distinguished between two approaches to virtualization.             One
kind of hypervisor, dubbed a type 1 hypervisor is illustrated in Fig. 7-1(a).        Tech-
nically, it is like an operating system, since it is the only program running in the
most privileged mode. Its job is to support multiple copies of the actual hardware,
called virtual machines, similar to the processes a normal operating system runs.
     In contrast, a type 2 hypervisor, shown in Fig. 7-1(b), is a different kind of
animal.   It is a program that relies on, say, Windows or Linux to allocate and
schedule resources, very much like a regular process. Of course, the type 2 hyper-
visor still pretends to be a full computer with a CPU and various devices. Both
types of hypervisor must execute the machine's instruction set in a safe manner.
For instance, an operating system running on top of the hypervisor may change and
even mess up its own page tables, but not those of others.
     The operating system running on top of the hypervisor in both cases is called
the guest operating system. For a type 2 hypervisor, the operating system running
on the hardware is called the host operating system.        The first type 2 hypervisor
