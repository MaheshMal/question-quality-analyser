MULTIPLE PROCESSOR SYSTEMS
Since its inception, the computer industry has been driven by an endless quest
for more and more computing power. The ENIAC could perform 300 operations
per second, easily 1000 times faster than any calculator before it, yet people were
not satisfied with it.  We now have machines millions of times faster than the
ENIAC and still there is a demand for yet more horsepower. Astronomers are try-
ing to make sense of the universe, biologists are trying to understand the implica-
tions of the human genome, and aeronautical engineers are interested in building
safer and more efficient aircraft, and all want more CPU cycles. However much
computing power there is, it is never enough.
In the past, the solution was always to make the clock run faster. Unfortunate-
ly, we have begun to hit some fundamental limits on clock speed.  According to
Einstein's special theory of relativity, no electrical signal can propagate faster than
the speed of light, which is about 30 cm/nsec in vacuum and about 20 cm/nsec in
copper wire or optical fiber. This means that in a computer with a 10-GHz clock,
the signals cannot travel more than 2 cm in total. For a 100-GHz computer the total
path length is at most 2 mm. A 1-THz (1000-GHz) computer will have to be smal-
ler than 100 microns, just to let the signal get from one end to the other and back
once within a single clock cycle.
Making computers this small may be possible, but then we hit another funda-
mental problem: heat dissipation. The faster the computer runs, the more heat it
generates, and the smaller the computer, the harder it is to get rid of this heat. Al-
ready on high-end x86 systems, the CPU cooler is bigger than the CPU itself. All
