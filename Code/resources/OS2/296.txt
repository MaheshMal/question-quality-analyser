FILES
or bitmaps are used to keep track of free storage and how many sectors there are in
a logical disk block are of no interest, although they are of great importance to the
designers of the file system. For this reason, we have structured the chapter as sev-
eral sections.  The first two are concerned with the user interface to files and direc-
tories, respectively. Then comes a detailed discussion of how the file system is im-
plemented and managed. Finally, we give some examples of real file systems.
