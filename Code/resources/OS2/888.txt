HISTORY OF WINDOWS THROUGH WINDOWS 8.1
Microsoft's development of the Windows operating system for PC-based com-
puters as well as servers can be divided into four eras: MS-DOS, MS-DOS-based
Windows, NT-based Windows, and Modern Windows.                     Technically, each of
these systems is substantially different from the others. Each was dominant during
different decades in the history of the personal computer.  Figure 11-1 shows the
dates of the major Microsoft operating system releases for desktop computers.
Below we will briefly sketch each of the eras shown in the table.

11.1.1 1980s: MS-DOS
     In the early 1980s IBM, at the time the biggest and most powerful computer
company in the world, was developing a personal computer based the Intel 8088
microprocessor.  Since the mid-1970s, Microsoft had become the leading provider
of the BASIC programming language for 8-bit microcomputers based on the 8080
and Z-80.  When IBM approached Microsoft about licensing BASIC for the new
IBM PC, Microsoft readily agreed and suggested that IBM contact Digital Re-
search to license its CP/M operating system, since Microsoft was not then in the
operating system business.  IBM did that, but the president of Digital Research,
Gary Kildall, was too busy to meet with IBM.       This was probably the worst blun-
der in all of business history, since had he licensed CP/M to IBM, Kildall would
probably have become the richest man on the planet.               Rebuffed by Kildall, IBM
came back to Bill Gates, the cofounder of Microsoft, and asked for help again.
Within a short time, Microsoft bought a CP/M clone from a local company, Seattle
Computer Products, ported it to the IBM PC, and licensed it to IBM.                It was then
renamed MS-DOS 1.0 (MicroSoft Disk Operating System) and shipped with the
first IBM PC in 1981.
