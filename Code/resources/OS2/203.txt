RESEARCH ON PROCESSES AND THREADS
     In Chap. 1, we looked at some of the current research in operating system
structure.  In this and subsequent chapters we will look at more narrowly focused
research, starting with processes.  As will become clear in time, some subjects are
much more settled than others.      Most of the research tends to be on the new topics,
rather than ones that have been around for decades.
     The concept of a process is an example of something that is fairly well settled.
Almost every system has some notion of a process as a container for grouping to-
gether related resources such as an address space, threads, open files, protection
permissions, and so on. Different systems do the grouping slightly differently, but
these are just engineering differences. The basic idea is not very controversial any
more, and there is little new research on the subject of processes.
     Threads are a newer idea than processes, but they, too, have been chewed over
quite a bit. Still, the occasional paper about threads appears from time to time, for
example, about thread clustering on multiprocessors (Tam et al., 2007), or on how
well modern operating systems like Linux scale with many threads and many cores
(Boyd-Wickizer, 2010).
     One particularly active research area deals with recording and replaying a
process' execution (Viennot et al., 2013). Replaying helps developers track down
hard-to-find bugs and security experts to investigate incidents.
