METRIC UNITS
To avoid any confusion, it is worth stating explicitly that in this book, as in
computer science in general, metric units are used instead of traditional English
units (the furlong-stone-fortnight system).  The principal metric prefixes are listed
in Fig. 1-31.     The prefixes are typically abbreviated by their first letters, with the
units greater than 1 capitalized. Thus a 1-TB database occupies 1012 bytes of stor-
age and a 100-psec (or 100-ps) clock ticks every 10-10 seconds. Since milli and
micro both begin with the letter ``m,'' a choice had to be made. Normally, ``m'' is
for milli and ``'' (the Greek letter mu) is for micro.
