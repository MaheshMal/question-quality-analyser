DIRECTORIES
     To keep track of files, file systems normally have directories or folders, which
are themselves files. In this section we will discuss directories, their organization,
their properties, and the operations that can be performed on them.
4.2.1 Single-Level Directory Systems
     The simplest form of directory system is having one directory containing all
the files. Sometimes it is called the root directory, but since it is the only one, the
name does not matter much.  On early personal computers, this system was com-
mon, in part because there was only one user. Interestingly enough, the world's
first supercomputer, the CDC 6600, also had only a single directory for all files,
even though it was used by many users at once. This decision was no doubt made
to keep the software design simple.
     An example of a system with one directory is given in Fig. 4-6.          Here the di-
rectory contains four files. The advantages of this scheme are its simplicity and the
ability to locate files quickly--there is only one place to look, after all.  It is some-
times still used on simple embedded devices such as digital cameras and some
portable music players.
4.2.2 Hierarchical Directory Systems
     The single level is adequate for very simple dedicated applications (and was
even used on the first personal computers), but for modern users with thousands of
files, it would be impossible to find anything if all files were in a single directory.
