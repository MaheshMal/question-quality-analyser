RESEARCH ON FILE SYSTEMS
File systems have always attracted more research than other parts of the oper-
ating system and that is still the case.    Entire conferences such as FAST, MSST,
and NAS, are devoted largely to file and storage systems.  While standard file sys-
tems are fairly well understood, there is still quite a bit of research going on about
backups (Smaldone et al., 2013; and Wallace et al., 2012) caching (Koller et al.;
Oh, 2012; and Zhang et al., 2013a), erasing data securely (Wei et al., 2011), file
compression (Harnik et al., 2013), flash file systems (No, 2012; Park and Shen,
2012; and Narayanan, 2009), performance (Leventhal, 2013; and Schindler et al.,
2011), RAID (Moon and Reddy, 2013), reliability and recovery from errors (Chi-
dambaram et al., 2013; Ma et. al, 2013; McKusick, 2012; and Van Moolenbroek et
al., 2012), user-level file systems (Rajgarhia and Gehani, 2010), verifying consis-
tency (Fryer et al., 2012), and versioning file systems (Mashtizadeh et al., 2013).
Just measuring what is actually going in a file system is also a research topic (Har-
ter et al., 2012).
Security is a perennial topic (Botelho et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013c; and Lorch
et al., 2013).  In contrast, a hot new topic is cloud file systems (Mazurek et al.,
