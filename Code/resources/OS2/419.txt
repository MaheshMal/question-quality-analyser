CLOCKS
     Clocks (also called timers) are essential to the operation of any multipro-
grammed system for a variety of reasons. They maintain the time of day and pre-
vent one process from monopolizing the CPU, among other things. The clock soft-
ware can take the form of a device driver, even though a clock is neither a block
device, like a disk, nor a character device, like a mouse. Our examination of clocks
will follow the same pattern as in the previous section: first a look at clock hard-
ware and then a look at the clock software.
5.5.1 Clock Hardware
     Two types of clocks are commonly used in computers, and both are quite dif-
ferent from the clocks and watches used by people. The simpler clocks are tied to
the 110- or 220-volt power line and cause an interrupt on every voltage cycle, at 50
or 60 Hz. These clocks used to dominate, but are rare nowadays.
     The other kind of clock is built out of three components: a crystal oscillator, a
counter, and a holding register, as shown in Fig. 5-28.  When a piece of quartz
crystal is properly cut and mounted under tension, it can be made to generate a
periodic signal of very great accuracy, typically in the range of several hundred
megahertz to a few gigahertz, depending on the crystal chosen. Using electronics,
