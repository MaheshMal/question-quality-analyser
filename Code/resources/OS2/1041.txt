PERFORMANCE
All things being equal, a fast operating system is better than a slow one. How-
ever, a fast unreliable operating system is not as good as a reliable slow one. Since
complex optimizations often lead to bugs, it is important to use them sparingly.
This notwithstanding, there are places where performance is critical and optimiza-
tions are worth the effort.  In the following sections, we will look at some tech-
niques that can be used to improve performance in places where that is called for.
