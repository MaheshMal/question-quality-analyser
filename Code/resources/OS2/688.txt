INSIDER ATTACKS
A whole different category of attacks are what might be termed ``inside jobs.''
These are executed by programmers and other employees of the company running
the computer to be protected or making critical software. These attacks differ from
external attacks because the insiders have specialized knowledge and access that
outsiders do not have. Below we will give a few examples; all of them have oc-
curred repeatedly in the past. Each one has a different flavor in terms of who is
doing the attacking, who is being attacked, and what the attacker is trying to
achieve.
9.8.1 Logic Bombs
In these times of massive outsourcing, programmers often worry about their
jobs. Sometimes they even take steps to make their potential (involuntary) depar-
ture less painful. For those who are inclined toward blackmail, one strategy is to
write a logic bomb.  This device is a piece of code written by one of a company's
(currently employed) programmers and secretly inserted into the production sys-
tem.  As long as the programmer feeds it its daily password, it is happy and does
nothing.  However, if the programmer is suddenly fired and physically removed

from the premises without warning, the next day (or next week) the logic bomb
does not get fed its daily password, so it goes off. Many variants on this theme are
also possible.      In one famous case, the logic bomb checked the payroll.        If the per-
sonnel number of the programmer did not appear in it for two consecutive payroll
periods, it went off (Spafford et al., 1989).
     Going off might involve clearing the disk, erasing files at random, carefully
making hard-to-detect changes to key programs, or encrypting essential files.               In
the latter case, the company has a tough choice about whether to call the police
(which may or may not result in a conviction many months later but certainly does
not restore the missing files) or to give in to the blackmail and rehire the ex-pro-
grammer as a ``consultant'' for an astronomical sum to fix the problem (and hope
that he does not plant new logic bombs while doing so).
     There have been recorded cases in which a virus planted a logic bomb on the
computers it infected. Generally, these were programmed to go off all at once at
some date and time in the future. However, since the programmer has no idea in
advance of which computers will be hit, logic bombs cannot be used for job pro-
tection or blackmail. Often they are set to go off on a date that has some political
significance. Sometimes these are called time bombs.
9.8.2 Back Doors
     Another security hole caused by an insider is the back door.                  This problem is
created by code inserted into the system by a system programmer to bypass some
normal check. For example, a programmer could add code to the login program to
allow anyone to log in using the login name ``zzzzz'' no matter what was in the
password file. The normal code in the login program might look something like
Fig. 9-26(a). The back door would be the change to Fig. 9-26(b).
while (TRUE) {                            while (TRUE) {
     printf("login: ");                        printf("login: ");
     get string(name);                         get string(name);
     disable echoing( );                       disable echoing( );
     printf("password: ");                     printf("password: ");
     get string(password);                     get string(password);
     enable echoing( );                        enable echoing( );
     v = check validity(name, password);       v = check validity(name, password);
     if (v) break;                             if (v || strcmp(name, "zzzzz") == 0) break;
}                                         }
execute shell(name);                      execute shell(name);
     (a)                                       (b)
                Figure 9-26. (a) Normal code. (b) Code with a back door inserted.
     What the call to strcmp does is check if the login name is ``zzzzz''.         If so, the
login succeeds, no matter what password is typed.         If this back-door code were
