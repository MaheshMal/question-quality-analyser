DEFENSES
     With  problems  lurking     everywhere,  is  there  any  hope  of  making  systems
secure?    Actually, there is, and in the following sections we will look at some of
the ways systems can be designed and implemented to increase their security. One
of the most important concepts is defense in depth. Basically, the idea here is that
you should have multiple layers of security so that if one of them is breached, there
are still others to overcome. Think about a house with a high, spiky, locked iron
fence around it, motion detectors in the yard, two industrial-strength locks on the
front door, and a computerized burglar alarm system inside. While each technique
is valuable by itself, to rob the house the burglar would have to defeat all of them.
