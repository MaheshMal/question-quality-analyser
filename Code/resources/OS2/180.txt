SCHEDULING
Adding a node:
           A                             A                           A
        B                             B                     X     B                      X
     C     D                E    C       D                  E  C     D                   E
        (a) Original tree.       (b) Initialize node X and     (c) When X is completely initialized,
                                 connect E to X. Any readers   connect X to A. Readers currently
                                 in A and E are not affected.  in E will have read the old version,
                                                               while readers in A will pick up the
                                                               new version of the tree.
Removing nodes:
           A                             A                           A
        B                   X         B                     X                            X
     C     D                E    C       D                  E  C                         E
(d) Decouple B from A. Note      (e) Wait until we are sure    (f) Now we can safely
that there may still be readers  that all readers have left B  remove B and D
in B. All readers in B will see  and C. These nodes cannot
the old version of the tree,     be accessed any more.
while all readers currently
in A will see the new version.

        a branch--all without locks.
