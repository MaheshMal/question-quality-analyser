RESEARCH ON VIRTUALIZATION AND THE CLOUD
     Virtualization technology and cloud computing are both extremely active re-
search areas.   The research produced in these fields is way too much to enumerate.
Each has multiple research conferences.  For instance, the Virtual Execution Envi-
ronments (VEE) conference focuses on virtualization in the broadest sense.               You
will find papers on migration deduplication, scaling out, and so on.  Likewise, the
ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SOCC) is one of the best-known venues
on cloud computing.    Papers in SOCC include work on fault resilience, scheduling
of data center workloads, management and debugging in clouds, and so on.
     Old topics never really die, as in Penneman et al. (2013), which looks at the
problems of virtualizing the ARM in the light of the Popek and Goldberg criteria.
Security is perpetually a hot topic (Beham et al., 2013; Mao, 2013; and Pearce et
al., 2013), as is reducing energy usage (Botero and Hesselbach, 2013; and Yuan et
al., 2013). With so many data centers now using virtualization technology, the net-
works connecting these machines are also a major subject of research (Theodorou
et al., 2013).  Virtualization in wireless networks is also an up-and-coming subject
(Wang et al., 2013a).
     One interesting area which has seen a lot of interesting research is nested virtu-
alization (Ben-Yehuda et al., 2010; and Zhang et al., 2011).  The idea is that a vir-
tual machine itself can be further virtualized into multiple higher-level virtual ma-
chines, which in turn may be virtualized and so on. One of these projects is appro-
priately called ``Turtles,'' because once you start, ``It's Turtles all the way down!''
