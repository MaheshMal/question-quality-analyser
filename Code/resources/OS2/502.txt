VIRTUALIZATION AND THE CLOUD
In some situations, an organization has a multicomputer but does not actually
want it. A common example is where a company has an email server, a Web server,
an FTP server, some e-commerce servers, and others. These all run on different
computers in the same equipment rack, all connected by a high-speed network, in
other words, a multicomputer. One reason all these servers run on separate ma-
chines may be that one machine cannot handle the load, but another is reliability:
management simply does not trust the operating system to run 24 hours a day, 365
or 366 days a year, with no failures. By putting each service on a separate com-
puter, if one of the servers crashes, at least the other ones are not affected. This is
good for security also. Even if some malevolent intruder manages to compromise
the Web server, he will not immediately have access to sensitive emails also--a
property sometimes referred to as sandboxing.  While isolation and fault tolerance
are achieved this way, this solution is expensive and hard to manage because so
many machines are involved.
Mind you, these are just two out of many reasons for keeping separate ma-
chines.  For instance, organizations often depend on more than one operating sys-
tem for their daily operations: a Web server on Linux, a mail server on Windows,
an e-commerce server for customers running on OS X, and a few other services
running on various flavors of UNIX. Again, this solution works, but cheap it is def-
initely not.
What to do? A possible (and popular) solution is to use virtual machine tech-
nology, which sounds very hip and modern, but the idea is old, dating back to the
