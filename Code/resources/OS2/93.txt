OPERATING SYSTEM STRUCTURE
    Now that we have seen what operating systems look like on the outside (i.e.,
the programmer's interface), it is time to take a look inside.        In the following sec-
tions, we will examine six different structures that have been tried, in order to get
some idea of the spectrum of possibilities. These are by no means exhaustive, but
they give an idea of some designs that have been tried in practice. The six designs
we will discuss here are monolithic systems, layered systems, microkernels, cli-
ent-server systems, virtual machines, and exokernels.
