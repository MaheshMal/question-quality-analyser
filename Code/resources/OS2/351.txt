EXAMPLE FILE SYSTEMS
     In the following sections we will discuss several example file systems, ranging
from quite simple to more sophisticated. Since modern UNIX file systems and
Windows 8's native file system are covered in the chapter on UNIX (Chap. 10) and
the chapter on Windows 8 (Chap. 11) we will not cover those systems here.              We
will, however, examine their predecessors below.
4.5.1 The MS-DOS File System
     The MS-DOS file system is the one the first IBM PCs came with.   It was the
main file system up through Windows 98 and Windows ME.  It is still supported
on Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista, although it is no longer stan-
dard on new PCs now except for floppy disks. However, it and an extension of it
(FAT-32) have become widely used for many embedded systems.           Most digital
cameras use it. Many MP3 players use it exclusively. The popular Apple iPod uses
it as the default file system, although knowledgeable hackers can reformat the iPod
and install a different file system. Thus the number of electronic devices using the
MS-DOS file system is vastly larger now than at any time in the past, and certainly
much larger than the number using the more modern NTFS file system. For that
reason alone, it is worth looking at in some detail.
     To read a file, an MS-DOS program must first make an open system call to get
a handle for it. The open system call specifies a path, which may be either absolute
or relative to the current working directory. The path is looked up component by
component until the final directory is located and read into memory.  It is then
searched for the file to be opened.
     Although MS-DOS directories are variable sized, they use a fixed-size 32-byte
directory entry. The format of an MS-DOS directory entry is shown in Fig. 4-30. It
contains the file name, attributes, creation date and time, starting block, and exact
