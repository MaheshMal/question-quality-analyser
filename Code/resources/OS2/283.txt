RESEARCH ON MEMORY MANAGEMENT
     Traditional memory management, especially paging algorithms for uniproces-
sor CPUs, was once a fruitful area for research, but most of that seems to have
largely died off, at least for general-purpose systems, although there are some peo-
ple who never say die (Moruz et al., 2012) or are focused on some application,
such as online transaction processing, that has specialized requirements (Stoica and
Ailamaki, 2013).  Even on uniprocessors, paging to SSDs rather than to hard disks
brings up new issues and requires new algorithms (Chen et al., 2012).  Paging to
the up-and-coming nonvolatile phase-change memories also requires rethinking
