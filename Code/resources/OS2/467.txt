RESOURCES
     A major class of deadlocks involves resources to which some process has been
granted exclusive access. These resources include devices, data records, files, and
so forth. To make the discussion of deadlocks as general as possible, we will refer
to the objects granted as resources.  A resource can be a hardware device (e.g., a
Blu-ray drive) or a piece of information (e.g., a record in a database).  A computer
will normally have many different resources that a process can acquire.    For some
resources,  several  identical  instances  may  be  available,  such  as  three  Blu-ray
drives.   When several copies of a resource are available, any one of them can be
used to satisfy any request for the resource.   In short, a resource is anything that
must be acquired, used, and released over the course of time.
6.1.1 Preemptable and Nonpreemptable Resources
     Resources come in two types: preemptable and nonpreemptable.         A preempt-
able resource is one that can be taken away from the process owning it with no ill
effects.  Memory is an example of a preemptable resource.       Consider, for example,
a system with 1 GB of user memory, one printer, and two 1-GB processes that each
want to print something.      Process A requests and gets the printer, then starts to
compute the values to print.    Before it has finished the computation, it exceeds its
time quantum and is swapped out to disk.
     Process B now runs and tries, unsuccessfully as it turns out, to acquire the
printer.  Potenially, we now have a deadlock situation, because A has the printer
and B has the memory, and neither one can proceed without the resource held by
the other.  Fortunately, it is possible to preempt (take away) the memory from B by
