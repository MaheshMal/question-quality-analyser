CACHING IN WINDOWS
     The Windows cache improves the performance of file systems by keeping
recently and frequently used regions of files in memory.    Rather than cache physi-
cal addressed blocks from the disk, the cache manager manages virtually addressed
blocks, that is, regions of files. This approach fits well with the structure of the
native NT File System (NTFS), as we will see in Sec. 11.8.  NTFS stores all of its
data as files, including the file-system metadata.
     The cached regions of files are called views because they represent regions of
kernel virtual addresses that are mapped onto file-system files.      Thus, the actual
management of the physical memory in the cache is provided by the memory man-
ager.  The role of the cache manager is to manage the use of kernel virtual ad-
dresses for views, arrange with the memory manager to pin pages in physical
memory, and provide interfaces for the file systems.
