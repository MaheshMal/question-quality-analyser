TRENDS IN OPERATING SYSTEM DESIGN
In 1899, the head of the U.S. Patent Office, Charles H. Duell, asked then-Presi-
dent McKinley to abolish the Patent Office (and his job!), because, as he put it:
``Everything that can be invented, has been invented'' (Cerf and Navasky, 1984).
Nevertheless, Thomas Edison showed up on his doorstep within a few years with a
couple of new items, including the electric light, the phonograph, and the movie
projector. The point is that the world is constantly changing and operating systems
must adapt to the new reality all the time. In this section, we mention a few trends
that are relevant for operating system designers today.
To avoid confusion, the hardware developments mentioned below are here
already.  What is not here is the operating system software to use them effectively.
