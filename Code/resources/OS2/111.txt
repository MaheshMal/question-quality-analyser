SUMMARY
    Operating systems can be viewed from two viewpoints: resource managers and
extended machines. In the resource-manager view, the operating system's job is to
manage the different parts of the system efficiently. In the extended-machine view,
the job of the system is to provide the users with abstractions that are more con-
venient to use than the actual machine. These include processes, address spaces,
and files.
    Operating systems have a long history, starting from the days when they re-
placed the operator, to modern multiprogramming systems. Highlights include
early batch systems, multiprogramming systems, and personal computer systems.
    Since operating systems interact closely with the hardware, some knowledge
of computer hardware is useful to understanding them. Computers are built up of
processors, memories, and I/O devices. These parts are connected by buses.
    The basic concepts on which all operating systems are built are processes,
memory management, I/O management, the file system, and security. Each of these
will be treated in a subsequent chapter.
