VIRTUAL APPLIANCES
Virtual   machines  offer  an        interesting  solution  to  a  problem  that   has  long
plagued users, especially users of open source software: how to install new appli-
cation programs. The problem is that many applications are dependent on numer-
ous other applications and libraries, which are themselves dependent on a host of
other software packages, and so on. Furthermore, there may be dependencies on
particular versions of the compilers, scripting languages, and the operating system.
With virtual machines now available, a software developer can carefully con-
struct a virtual machine, load it with the required operating system, compilers, li-
braries, and application code, and freeze the entire unit, ready to run.        This virtual
machine image can then be put on a CD-ROM or a Website for customers to install
or download. This approach means that only the software developer has to under-
stand all the dependencies. The customers get a complete package that actually
works, completely independent of which operating system they are running and
which other software, packages, and libraries they have installed.          These ``shrink-
wrapped'' virtual machines are often called virtual appliances.           As an example,
Amazon's EC2 cloud has many pre-packaged virtual appliances available for its
clients, which it offers as convenient software services (``Software as a Service'').
