COMPUTER HARDWARE REVIEW
     An operating system is intimately tied to the hardware of the computer it runs
on.  It extends the computer's instruction set and manages its resources.                     To work,
it must know a great deal about the hardware, at least about how the hardware ap-
pears to the programmer. For this reason, let us briefly review computer hardware
as found in modern personal computers. After that, we can start getting into the de-
tails of what operating systems do and how they work.
     Conceptually, a simple personal computer can be abstracted to a model resem-
bling that of Fig. 1-6.  The CPU, memory, and I/O devices are all connected by a
system bus and communicate with one another over it. Modern personal computers
have a more complicated structure, involving multiple buses, which we will look at
later. For the time being, this model will be sufficient.               In the following sections,
we will briefly review these components and examine some of the hardware issues
that are of concern to operating system designers. Needless to say, this will be a
very compact summary. Many books have been written on the subject of computer
hardware and computer organization.                  Two well-known ones are by Tanenbaum
and Austin (2012) and Patterson and Hennessy (2013).
