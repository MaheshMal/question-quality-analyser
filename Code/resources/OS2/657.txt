AUTHENTICATION
     Every secured computer system must require all users to be authenticated at
login time. After all, if the operating system cannot be sure who the user is, it can-
not know which files and other resources he can access. While authentication may
sound like a trivial topic, it is a bit more complicated than you might expect. Read
on.
     User authentication is one of those things we meant by ``ontogeny recapitu-
lates phylogeny'' in Sec. 1.5.7.  Early mainframes, such as the ENIAC, did not
have an operating system, let alone a login procedure. Later mainframe batch and
timesharing systems generally did have a login procedure for authenticating jobs
and users.
     Early minicomputers (e.g., PDP-1 and PDP-8) did not have a login procedure,
but with the spread of UNIX on the PDP-11 minicomputer, logging in was again
needed. Early personal computers (e.g., Apple II and the original IBM PC) did not
