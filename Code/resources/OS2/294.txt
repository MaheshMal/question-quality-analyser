FILE SYSTEMS
All computer applications need to store and retrieve information. While a proc-
ess is running, it can store a limited amount of information within its own address
space. However, the storage capacity is restricted to the size of the virtual address
space. For some applications this size is adequate, but for others, such as airline
reservations, banking, or corporate record keeping, it is far too small.
A second problem with keeping information within a process' address space is
that when the process terminates, the information is lost. For many applications
(e.g., for databases), the information must be retained for weeks, months, or even
forever. Having it vanish when the process using it terminates is unacceptable.
Furthermore, it must not go away when a computer crash kills the process.
A third problem is that it is frequently necessary for multiple processes to ac-
cess (parts of) the information at the same time. If we have an online telephone di-
rectory stored inside the address space of a single process, only that process can
access it. The way to solve this problem is to make the information itself indepen-
dent of any one process.
Thus, we have three essential requirements for long-term information storage:
1.  It must be possible to store a very large amount of information.
2.  The information must survive the termination of the process using it.
3.  Multiple processes must be able to access the information at once.
Magnetic disks have been used for years for this long-term storage.        In recent
years, solid-state drives have become increasingly popular, as they do not have any
