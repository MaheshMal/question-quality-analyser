        The basic idea is that the several components in any complex system
        will perform particular subfunctions that contribute to the overall
        function.

     LEARNING OBJECTIVES
     After studying this chapter, you should be able to:
     ·     Understand the distinction between process and thread.
     ·     Describe the basic design issues for threads.
     ·     Explain the difference between user-level threads and kernel-level threads.
     ·     Describe the thread management facility in Windows 7.
     ·     Describe the thread management facility in Solaris.
     ·     Describe the thread management facility in Linux.
     This chapter examines some more advanced concepts related to process manage-
     ment, which are found in a number of contemporary operating systems. We show
     that the concept of process is more complex and subtle than presented so far and in
     fact embodies two separate and potentially independent concepts: one relating to
     resource ownership and another relating to execution. This distinction has led to the
     development, in many operating systems, of a construct known as the thread.
