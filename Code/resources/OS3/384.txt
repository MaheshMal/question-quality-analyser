Contiguous Memory Allocation
     The main memory must accommodate both the operating system and the
     various user processes. We therefore need to allocate main memory in the most
     efficient way possible. This section explains one early method, contiguous
     memory allocation.
     The memory is usually divided into two partitions: one for the resident
     operating system and one for the user processes. We can place the operating
     system in either low memory or high memory. The major factor affecting this
     decision is the location of the interrupt vector. Since the interrupt vector is
     often in low memory, programmers usually place the operating system in low
     memory as well. Thus, in this text, we discuss only the situation in which
