RAID Structure
      Disk drives have continued to get smaller and cheaper, so it is now econom-
      ically feasible to attach many disks to a computer system. Having a large
      number of disks in a system presents opportunities for improving the rate
      at which data can be read or written, if the disks are operated in parallel.
      Furthermore, this setup offers the potential for improving the reliability of data
      storage, because redundant information can be stored on multiple disks. Thus,
      failure of one disk does not lead to loss of data. A variety of disk-organization
      techniques, collectively called redundant arrays of independent disks (RAID),
      are commonly used to address the performance and reliability issues.
      In the past, RAIDs composed of small, cheap disks were viewed as a
      cost-effective alternative to large, expensive disks. Today, RAIDs are used for
