Access Matrix
      Our general model of protection can be viewed abstractly as a matrix, called
      an access matrix. The rows of the access matrix represent domains, and the
      columns represent objects. Each entry in the matrix consists of a set of access
      rights. Because the column defines objects explicitly, we can omit the object
      name from the access right. The entry access(i,j) defines the set of operations
      that a process executing in domain Di can invoke on object Oj .
      To illustrate these concepts, we consider the access matrix shown in Figure
      14.3. There are four domains and four objects--three files (F1, F2, F3) and one
      laser printer. A process executing in domain D1 can read files F1 and F3. A
      process executing in domain D4 has the same privileges as one executing in
                               object

                  D1                   read                 read
                  D2                                                 print
                  D3                                read    execute
                  D4                   read                 read
