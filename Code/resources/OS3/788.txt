Design Issues
      Making the multiplicity of processors and storage devices transparent to the
      users has been a key challenge to many designers. Ideally, a distributed system
      should look to its users like a conventional, centralized system. The user
      interface of a transparent distributed system should not distinguish between
      local and remote resources. That is, users should be able to access remote
      resources as though these resources were local, and the distributed system
      should be responsible for locating the resources and for arranging for the
      appropriate interaction.
      Another aspect of transparency is user mobility. It would be convenient to
      allow users to log into any machine in the system rather than forcing them to use
      a specific machine. A transparent distributed system facilitates user mobility
      by bringing over the user's environment (for example, home directory) to
      wherever he logs in. Protocols like LDAP provide an authentication system for
