Summary
      help find and fix bugs, and otherwise explore mature, full-featured operating
      systems, compilers, tools, user interfaces, and other types of programs. The
      availability of source code for historic projects, such as Multics, can help
      students to understand those projects and to build knowledge that will help in
      the implementation of new projects.
          GNU/Linux and BSD UNIX are all open-source operating systems, but each
      has its own goals, utility, licensing, and purpose. Sometimes, licenses are not
      mutually exclusive and cross-pollination occurs, allowing rapid improvements
      in  operating-system      projects.  For  example,  several  major  components    of
      OpenSolaris have been ported to BSD UNIX. The advantages of free software
      and open sourcing are likely to increase the number and quality of open-source
      projects, leading to an increase in the number of individuals and companies
      that use these projects.
