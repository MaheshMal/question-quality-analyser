Feature Migration
      One reason to study early architectures and operating systems is that a feature
      that once ran only on huge systems may eventually make its way into very
      small systems. Indeed, an examination of operating systems for mainframes
      and microcomputers shows that many features once available only on main-
      frames have been adopted for microcomputers. The same operating-system
      concepts are thus appropriate for various classes of computers: mainframes,
      minicomputers, microcomputers, and handhelds. To understand modern oper-
      ating systems, then, you need to recognize the theme of feature migration and
      the long history of many operating-system features, as shown in Figure 20.1.
      A good example of feature migration started with the Multiplexed Infor-
      mation and Computing Services (MULTICS) operating system. MULTICS was
                                                                                       887
