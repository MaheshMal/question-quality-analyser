Goals of Protection
      As computer systems have become more sophisticated and pervasive in their
      applications, the need to protect their integrity has also grown. Protection was
      originally conceived as an adjunct to multiprogramming operating systems,
      so that untrustworthy users might safely share a common logical name space,
      such as a directory of files, or share a common physical name space, such as
      memory. Modern protection concepts have evolved to increase the reliability
      of any complex system that makes use of shared resources.
      We need to provide protection for several reasons. The most obvious is the
      need to prevent the mischievous, intentional violation of an access restriction
                                                                                        625
