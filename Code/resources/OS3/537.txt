      functions operate in terms of blocks. The conversion from logical records to
      physical blocks is a relatively simple software problem.
      Because disk space is always allocated in blocks, some portion of the last
      block of each file is generally wasted. If each block were 512 bytes, for example,
      then a file of 1,949 bytes would be allocated four blocks (2,048 bytes); the last
      99 bytes would be wasted. The waste incurred to keep everything in units
      of blocks (instead of bytes) is internal fragmentation. All file systems suffer
      from internal fragmentation; the larger the block size, the greater the internal
      fragmentation.
