User Authentication
      domain name --of the server with which it is communicating. For applications
      in which the server also needs information about the client, SSL supports an
      option by which a client can send a certificate to the server.
      In addition to its use on the Internet, SSL is being used for a wide variety
      of tasks. For example, IPSec VPNs now have a competitor in SSL VPNs. IPSec
      is good for point-to-point encryption of traffic--say, between two company
      offices. SSL VPNs are more flexible but not as efficient, so they might be used
      between an individual employee working remotely and the corporate office.
