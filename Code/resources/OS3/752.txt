Virtualization and Operating-System Components
      Thus far, we have explored the building blocks of virtualization and the various
      types of virtualization. In this section, we take a deeper dive into the operating-
      system  aspects  of  virtualization,  including    how  the     VMM    provides  core
      operating-system functions like scheduling, I/O, and memory management.
      Here, we answer questions such as these: How do VMMs schedule CPU use
      when guest operating systems believe they have dedicated CPUs? How can
      memory management work when many guests require large amounts of
      memory?
