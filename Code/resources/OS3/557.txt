      ·  One mode of sharing allows users to share the pointer of current location
         into the file. Thus, the advancing of the pointer by one user affects all
         sharing users. Here, a file has a single image that interleaves all accesses,
         regardless of their origin.
      In the UNIX semantics, a file is associated with a single physical image that
      is accessed as an exclusive resource. Contention for this single image causes
      delays in user processes.
      11.5.3.2   Session Semantics
      The Andrew file system (OpenAFS) uses the following consistency semantics:
      ·  Writes to an open file by a user are not visible immediately to other users
         that have the same file open.
      ·  Once a file is closed, the changes made to it are visible only in sessions
         starting later. Already open instances of the file do not reflect these changes.
      According to these semantics, a file may be associated temporarily with several
      (possibly different) images at the same time. Consequently, multiple users are
      allowed to perform both read and write accesses concurrently on their images
      of the file, without delay. Almost no constraints are enforced on scheduling
      accesses.
      11.5.3.3   Immutable-Shared-Files Semantics
      A unique approach is that of immutable shared files. Once a file is declared
      as shared by its creator, it cannot be modified. An immutable file has two key
      properties: its name may not be reused, and its contents may not be altered.
      Thus, the name of an immutable file signifies that the contents of the file are
      fixed. The implementation of these semantics in a distributed system (Chapter
      17) is simple, because the sharing is disciplined (read-only).
