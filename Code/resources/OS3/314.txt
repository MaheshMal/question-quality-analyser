Operating-System Examples
     We turn next to a description of the scheduling policies of the Linux, Windows,
     and Solaris operating systems. It is important to note that we use the term
     process scheduling in a general sense here. In fact, we are describing the
     scheduling of kernel threads with Solaris and Windows systems and of tasks
     with the Linux scheduler.
     6.7.1    Example: Linux Scheduling
     Process scheduling in Linux has had an interesting history. Prior to Version 2.5,
     the Linux kernel ran a variation of the traditional UNIX scheduling algorithm.
