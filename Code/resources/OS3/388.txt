     As we've already seen, the user's view of memory is not the same as the actual
     physical memory. This is equally true of the programmer's view of memory.
     Indeed, dealing with memory in terms of its physical properties is inconvenient
     to both the operating system and the programmer. What if the hardware could
     provide a memory mechanism that mapped the programmer's view to the
     actual physical memory? The system would have more freedom to manage
     memory, while the programmer would have a more natural programming
     environment.
