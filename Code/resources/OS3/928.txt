Other Systems
     There are, of course, other operating systems, and most of them have interesting
     properties. The MCP operating system for the Burroughs computer family
     was the first to be written in a system programming language. It supported
     segmentation and multiple CPUs. The SCOPE operating system for the CDC
     6600 was also a multi-CPU system. The coordination and synchronization of
     the multiple processes were surprisingly well designed.
     History is littered with operating systems that suited a purpose for a time
     (be it a long or a short time) and then, when faded, were replaced by operating
     systems that had more features, supported newer hardware, were easier to use,
     or were better marketed. We are sure this trend will continue in the future.
