      as a huge buffer for reading as far ahead as possible on input devices and for
      storing output files until the output devices are able to accept them.
      Spooling is also used for processing data at remote sites. The CPU sends
      the data via communication paths to a remote printer (or accepts an entire
      input job from a remote card reader). The remote processing is done at its own
      speed, with no CPU intervention. The CPU just needs to be notified when the
      processing is completed, so that it can spool the next batch of data.
      Spooling overlaps the I/O of one job with the computation of other jobs.
      Even in a simple system, the spooler may be reading the input of one job while
      printing the output of a different job. During this time, still another job (or
      other jobs) may be executed, reading its "cards" from disk and "printing" its
      output lines onto the disk.
      Spooling has a direct beneficial effect on the performance of the system.
      For the cost of some disk space and a few tables, the computation of one job
      and the I/O of other jobs can take place at the same time. Thus, spooling can
      keep both the CPU and the I/O devices working at much higher rates. Spooling
      leads naturally to multiprogramming, which is the foundation of all modern
      operating systems.
