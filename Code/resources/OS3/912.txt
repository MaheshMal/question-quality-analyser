Early Systems
      We turn our attention now to a historical overview of early computer systems.
      We should note that the history of computing starts far before "computers" with
      looms and calculators. We begin our discussion, however, with the computers
      of the twentieth century.
      Before the 1940s, computing devices were designed and implemented to
      perform specific, fixed tasks. Modifying one of those tasks required a great deal
      of effort and manual labor. All that changed in the 1940s when Alan Turing and
      John von Neumann (and colleagues), both separately and together, worked on
