Benefits and Features
      Several advantages make virtualization attractive. Most of them are fundamen-
      tally related to the ability to share the same hardware yet run several different
      execution environments (that is, different operating systems) concurrently.
           One   important   advantage        of  virtualization  is   that  the  host  system    is
      protected from the virtual machines, just as the virtual machines are protected
      from each other. A virus inside a guest operating system might damage that
      operating system but is unlikely to affect the host or the other guests. Because
      each  virtual     machine  is   almost  completely  isolated       from   all  other  virtual
      machines, there are almost no protection problems.
           A potential disadvantage of isolation is that it can prevent sharing of
      resources. Two approaches to provide sharing have been implemented. First,
      it is possible to share a file-system volume and thus to share files. Second,
      it is possible to define a network of virtual machines, each of which can
