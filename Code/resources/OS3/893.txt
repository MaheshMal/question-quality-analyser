Networking
      even across volumes. NTFS also supports hard links, where a single file has an
      entry in more than one directory of the same volume.
      19.5.7   Change Journal
      NTFS keeps a journal describing all changes that have been made to the file
      system. User-mode services can receive notifications of changes to the journal
      and then identify what files have changed by reading from the journal. The
      search indexer service uses the change journal to identify files that need to be
      re-indexed. The file-replication service uses it to identify files that need to be
      replicated across the network.
      19.5.8   Volume Shadow Copies
      Windows implements the capability of bringing a volume to a known state
      and then creating a shadow copy that can be used to back up a consistent
      view of the volume. This technique is known as snapshots in some other file
      systems. Making a shadow copy of a volume is a form of copy-on-write, where
      blocks modified after the shadow copy is created are stored in their original
      form in the copy. To achieve a consistent state for the volume requires the
      cooperation of applications, since the system cannot know when the data used
      by the application are in a stable state from which the application could be
      safely restarted.
      The server version of Windows uses shadow copies to efficiently maintain
      old versions of files stored on file servers. This allows users to see documents
      stored on file servers as they existed at earlier points in time. The user can use
      this feature to recover files that were accidentally deleted or simply to look at
      a previous version of the file, all without pulling out backup media.
