Memory-Mapped Files
     Consider a sequential read of a file on disk using the standard system calls
     open(), read(), and write(). Each file access requires a system call and disk
     access. Alternatively, we can use the virtual memory techniques discussed
     so far to treat file I/O as routine memory accesses. This approach, known as
     memory mapping a file, allows a part of the virtual address space to be logically
     associated with the file. As we shall see, this can lead to significant performance
     increases.
     9.7.1            Basic Mechanism
     Memory mapping a file is accomplished by mapping a disk block to a page (or
     pages) in memory. Initial access to the file proceeds through ordinary demand
     paging, resulting in a page fault. However, a page-sized portion of the file is
     read from the file system into a physical page (some systems may opt to read
