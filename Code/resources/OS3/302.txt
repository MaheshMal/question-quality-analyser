Multiple-Processor Scheduling
     Our discussion thus far has focused on the problems of scheduling the CPU in
     a system with a single processor. If multiple CPUs are available, load sharing
     becomes possible --but scheduling problems become correspondingly more
     complex. Many possibilities have been tried; and as we saw with single-
     processor CPU scheduling, there is no one best solution.
        Here,    we  discuss    several  concerns  in   multiprocessor            scheduling.     We
     concentrate on systems in which the processors are identical--homogeneous
     --in terms of their functionality. We can then use any available processor to
     run any process in the queue. Note, however, that even with homogeneous
     multiprocessors, there are sometimes limitations on scheduling. Consider a
     system with an I/O device attached to a private bus of one processor. Processes
     that wish to use that device must be scheduled to run on that processor.
