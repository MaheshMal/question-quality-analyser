CP/M and MS/DOS
       Minicomputers  came   along  and  decreased  the  need   for   large   monolithic
       systems. They were followed by workstations and then personal computers,
       which put computing power closer and closer to the end users.
20.10 TOPS-20
       DEC created many influential computer systems during its history. Probably
       the most famous operating system associated with DEC is VMS, a popular
       business-oriented system that is still in use today as OpenVMS, a product of
       Hewlett-Packard. But perhaps the most influential of DEC's operating systems
       was TOPS-20.
       TOPS-20 started life as a research project at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman
       (BBN)  around  1970.  BBN  took  the  business-oriented  DEC   PDP-10  computer
       running TOPS-10, added a hardware memory-paging system to implement
       virtual memory, and wrote a new operating system for that computer to take
       advantage of the new hardware features. The result was TENEX, a general-
       purpose timesharing system. DEC then purchased the rights to TENEX and
       created a new computer with a built-in hardware pager. The resulting system
       was the DECSYSTEM-20 and the TOPS-20 operating system.
       TOPS-20 had an advanced command-line interpreter that provided help as
       needed to users. That, in combination with the power of the computer and
       its reasonable price, made the DECSYSTEM-20 the most popular time-sharing
       system of its time. In 1984, DEC stopped work on its line of 36-bit PDP-10
       computers to concentrate on 32-bit VAX systems running VMS.
