File-System Mounting
      Just as a file must be opened before it is used, a file system must be mounted
      before it can be available to processes on the system. More specifically, the
      directory structure may be built out of multiple volumes, which must be
      mounted to make them available within the file-system name space.
      The mount procedure is straightforward. The operating system is given the
      name of the device and the mount point--the location within the file structure
      where the file system is to be attached. Some operating systems require that a
      file system type be provided, while others inspect the structures of the device
      and determine the type of file system. Typically, a mount point is an empty
      directory. For instance, on a UNIX system, a file system containing a user's home
      directories might be mounted as /home; then, to access the directory structure
      within that file system, we could precede the directory names with /home, as
      in /home/jane. Mounting that file system under /users would result in the
      path name /users/jane, which we could use to reach the same directory.
      Next, the operating system verifies that the device contains a valid file
      system. It does so by asking the device driver to read the device directory
      and verifying that the directory has the expected format. Finally, the operating
      system notes in its directory structure that a file system is mounted at the
      specified mount point. This scheme enables the operating system to traverse
      its directory structure, switching among file systems, and even file systems of
      varying types, as appropriate.
