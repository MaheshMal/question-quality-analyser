     systems do not have conflicting license agreements. For example, DTrace has
     been added to Mac OS X and FreeBSD and will likely spread further due to its
     unique capabilities. Other operating systems, especially the Linux derivatives,
     are adding kernel-tracing functionality as well. Still other operating systems
     are beginning to include performance and tracing tools fostered by research at
     various institutions, including the Paradyn project.
