Operating-System Design and Implementation
     of daemons. In addition, operating systems that run important activities
     in user context rather than in kernel context may use daemons to run these
     activities.
     Along with system programs, most operating systems are supplied with
     programs that are useful in solving common problems or performing common
     operations. Such application programs include Web browsers, word proces-
     sors and text formatters, spreadsheets, database systems, compilers, plotting
     and statistical-analysis packages, and games.
     The view of the operating system seen by most users is defined by the
     application and system programs, rather than by the actual system calls.
     Consider a user's PC. When a user's computer is running the Mac OS X
     operating system, the user might see the GUI, featuring a mouse-and-windows
     interface. Alternatively, or even in one of the windows, the user might have a
     command-line UNIX shell. Both use the same set of system calls, but the system
     calls look different and act in different ways. Further confusing the user view,
     consider the user dual-booting from Mac OS X into Windows. Now the same
     user on the same hardware has two entirely different interfaces and two sets of
     applications using the same physical resources. On the same hardware, then,
     a user can be exposed to multiple user interfaces sequentially or concurrently.
