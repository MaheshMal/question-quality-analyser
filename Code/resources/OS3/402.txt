Structure of the Page Table
     In this section, we explore some of the most common techniques for structuring
     the page table, including hierarchical paging, hashed page tables, and inverted
     page tables.
     8.6.1  Hierarchical Paging
     Most   modern  computer    systems   support     a  large  logical  address  space
     (232 to 264). In such an environment, the page table itself becomes excessively
     large. For example, consider a system with a 32-bit logical address space. If
     the page size in such a system is 4 KB (212), then a page table may consist of
     up to 1 million entries (232/212). Assuming that each entry consists of 4 bytes,
     each process may need up to 4 MB of physical address space for the page table
     alone. Clearly, we would not want to allocate the page table contiguously in
     main memory. One simple solution to this problem is to divide the page table
     into smaller pieces. We can accomplish this division in several ways.
     One way is to use a two-level paging algorithm, in which the page table
     itself is also paged (Figure 8.17). For example, consider again the system with
     a 32-bit logical address space and a page size of 4 KB. A logical address is
     divided into a page number consisting of 20 bits and a page offset consisting
     of 12 bits. Because we page the page table, the page number is further divided
