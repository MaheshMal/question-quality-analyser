Overview
      The  control  of  devices  connected  to  the  computer  is   a  major  concern    of
      operating-system  designers.  Because     I/O  devices  vary   so  widely  in  their
      function and speed (consider a mouse, a hard disk, and a tape robot), varied
      methods are needed to control them. These methods form the I/O subsystem
      of the kernel, which separates the rest of the kernel from the complexities of
      managing I/O devices.
