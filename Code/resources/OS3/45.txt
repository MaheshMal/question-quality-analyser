Operating-System Operations
     memory (Chapter 9). The main advantage of the virtual-memory scheme is that
     it enables users to run programs that are larger than actual physical memory.
     Further, it abstracts main memory into a large, uniform array of storage,
     separating logical memory as viewed by the user from physical memory.
     This     arrangement  frees  programmers  from  concern  over      memory-storage
     limitations.
     A time-sharing system must also provide a file system (Chapters 11 and
     12). The file system resides on a collection of disks; hence, disk management
     must be provided (Chapter 10). In addition, a time-sharing system provides
     a mechanism for protecting resources from inappropriate use (Chapter 14).
     To ensure orderly execution, the system must provide mechanisms for job
     synchronization and communication (Chapter 5), and it may ensure that jobs
     do not get stuck in a deadlock, forever waiting for one another (Chapter 7).
