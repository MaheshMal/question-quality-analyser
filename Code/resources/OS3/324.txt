Algorithm Evaluation
     How do we select a CPU-scheduling algorithm for a particular system? As we
     saw in Section 6.3, there are many scheduling algorithms, each with its own
     parameters. As a result, selecting an algorithm can be difficult.
        The first problem is defining the criteria to be used in selecting an algorithm.
     As we saw in Section 6.2, criteria are often defined in terms of CPU utilization,
     response time, or throughput. To select an algorithm, we must first define
     the relative importance of these elements. Our criteria may include several
     measures, such as these:
     ·    Maximizing    CPU  utilization    under  the    constraint      that  the  maximum
          response time is 1 second
     ·    Maximizing throughput such that turnaround time is (on average) linearly
          proportional to total execution time
        Once the selection criteria have been defined, we want to evaluate the
     algorithms  under  consideration.      We  next  describe       the  various    evaluation
     methods we can use.
     6.8.1  Deterministic Modeling
     One  major  class  of   evaluation     methods   is  analytic    evaluation.        Analytic
     evaluation uses the given algorithm and the system workload to produce
     a formula or number to evaluate the performance of the algorithm for that
     workload.
        Deterministic modeling is one type of analytic evaluation. This method
     takes a particular predetermined workload and defines the performance of each
     algorithm for that workload. For example, assume that we have the workload
     shown below. All five processes arrive at time 0, in the order given, with the
     length of the CPU burst given in milliseconds:
                                     Process    Burst Time
                                        P1            10
                                        P2            29
                                        P3            3
                                        P4            7
                                        P5            12
     Consider    the  FCFS,  SJF,  and  RR  (quantum      =  10  milliseconds)       scheduling
     algorithms for this set of processes. Which algorithm would give the minimum
     average waiting time?
        For the FCFS algorithm, we would execute the processes as
            P1                          P2                   P3      P4              P5
     0           10                                       39     42       49              61
