System Components
      The architecture of Windows is a layered system of modules, as shown in Figure
      19.1. The main layers are the HAL, the kernel, and the executive, all of which
      run in kernel mode, and a collection of subsystems and services that run in user
      mode. The user-mode subsystems fall into two categories: the environmental
      subsystems, which emulate different operating systems, and the protection
      subsystems, which provide security functions. One of the chief advantages of
      this type of architecture is that interactions between modules are kept simple.
      The remainder of this section describes these layers and subsystems.
      19.3.1  Hardware-Abstraction Layer
      The HAL is the layer of software that hides hardware chipset differences from
      upper levels of the operating system. The HAL exports a virtual hardware
