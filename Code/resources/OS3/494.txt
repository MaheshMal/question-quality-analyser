Disk Structure
      Modern magnetic disk drives are addressed as large one-dimensional arrays of
      logical blocks, where the logical block is the smallest unit of transfer. The size
      of a logical block is usually 512 bytes, although some disks can be low-level
      formatted to have a different logical block size, such as 1,024 bytes. This option
      is described in Section 10.5.1. The one-dimensional array of logical blocks is
      mapped onto the sectors of the disk sequentially. Sector 0 is the first sector
      of the first track on the outermost cylinder. The mapping proceeds in order
      through that track, then through the rest of the tracks in that cylinder, and then
      through the rest of the cylinders from outermost to innermost.
      By using this mapping, we can--at least in theory--convert a logical block
      number into an old-style disk address that consists of a cylinder number, a track
      number within that cylinder, and a sector number within that track. In practice,
      it is difficult to perform this translation, for two reasons. First, most disks have
      some defective sectors, but the mapping hides this by substituting spare sectors
      from elsewhere on the disk. Second, the number of sectors per track is not a
      constant on some drives.
      Let's look more closely at the second reason. On media that use constant
      linear velocity (CLV), the density of bits per track is uniform. The farther a
      track is from the center of the disk, the greater its length, so the more sectors it
      can hold. As we move from outer zones to inner zones, the number of sectors
      per track decreases. Tracks in the outermost zone typically hold 40 percent
      more sectors than do tracks in the innermost zone. The drive increases its
      rotation speed as the head moves from the outer to the inner tracks to keep
      the same rate of data moving under the head. This method is used in CD-ROM
