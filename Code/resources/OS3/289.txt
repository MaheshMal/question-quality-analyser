Scheduling Criteria
     6.1.4  Dispatcher
     Another component involved in the CPU-scheduling function is the dispatcher.
     The dispatcher is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected
     by the short-term scheduler. This function involves the following:
     ·  Switching context
     ·  Switching to user mode
     ·  Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program
     The dispatcher should be as fast as possible, since it is invoked during every
     process switch. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and
     start another running is known as the dispatch latency.
