Firewalling to Protect Systems and Networks
      We turn next to the question of how a trusted computer can be connected
      safely to an untrustworthy network. One solution is the use of a firewall to
      separate trusted and untrusted systems. A firewall is a computer, appliance,
      or router that sits between the trusted and the untrusted. A network firewall
      limits network access between the two security domains and monitors and
      logs all connections. It can also limit connections based on source or destination
      address, source or destination port, or direction of the connection. For instance,
      web servers use HTTP to communicate with web browsers. A firewall therefore
      may allow only HTTP to pass from all hosts outside the firewall to the web
      server within the firewall. The Morris Internet worm used the finger protocol
      to break into computers, so finger would not be allowed to pass, for example.
         In fact, a network firewall can separate a network into multiple domains.
      A  common        implementation  has   the  Internet  as  the  untrusted  domain;   a
      semitrusted and semisecure network, called the demilitarized zone (DMZ),
      as another domain; and a company's computers as a third domain (Figure
