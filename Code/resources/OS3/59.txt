                           LINUX KERNEL DATA STRUCTURES
      The data structures used in the Linux kernel are available in the kernel source
      code. The include file <linux/list.h> provides details of the linked-list
      data structure used throughout the kernel. A queue in Linux is known as
      a kfifo, and its implementation can be found in the kfifo.c file in the
      kernel directory of the source code. Linux also provides a balanced binary
      search tree implementation using red-black trees. Details can be found in the
      include file <linux/rbtree.h>.
