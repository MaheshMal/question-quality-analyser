Multithreading Models
     Fundamentally, then, data parallelism involves the distribution of data
     across multiple cores and task parallelism on the distribution of tasks across
     multiple cores. In practice, however, few applications strictly follow either data
     or task parallelism. In most instances, applications use a hybrid of these two
     strategies.
