System Boot
      After an operating system is generated, it must be made available for use by
      the hardware. But how does the hardware know where the kernel is or how to
      load that kernel? The procedure of starting a computer by loading the kernel
      is known as booting the system. On most computer systems, a small piece of
      code known as the bootstrap program or bootstrap loader locates the kernel,
      loads it into main memory, and starts its execution. Some computer systems,
      such as PCs, use a two-step process in which a simple bootstrap loader fetches
      a more complex boot program from disk, which in turn loads the kernel.
          When a CPU receives a reset event--for instance, when it is powered up
      or rebooted--the instruction register is loaded with a predefined memory
