File System
      Users can also create new sessions, or connect to existing sessions, on one
      PC from a session running on another Windows PC. The terminal server (TS)
      connects one of the GUI windows in a user's local session to the new or existing
      session, called a remote desktop, on the remote computer. The most common
      use of remote desktops is for users to connect to a session on their work PC
      from their home PC.
      Many corporations use corporate terminal-server systems maintained in
      data centers to run all user sessions that access corporate resources, rather than
      allowing users to access those resources from the PCs in each user's office. Each
      server computer may handle many dozens of remote-desktop sessions. This
      is a form of thin-client computing, in which individual computers rely on a
      server for many functions. Relying on data-center terminal servers improves
      reliability, manageability, and security of the corporate computing resources.
      The TS is also used by Windows to implement remote assistance. A remote
      user can be invited to share a session with the user logged on to the session on
      the console. The remote user can watch the user's actions and even be given
      control of the desktop to help resolve computing problems.
