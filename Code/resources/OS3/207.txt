Threading Issues
         dispatch queue t         queue     =  dispatch get global queue
            (DISPATCH     QUEUE   PRIORITY         DEFAULT,      0);
         dispatch async(queue,           ^{    printf("I        am   a  block.");      });
     Internally,   GCD's  thread  pool  is   composed   of  POSIX       threads.  GCD  actively
     manages      the  pool,  allowing  the    number   of  threads     to  grow  and  shrink
     according to application demand and system capacity.
     4.5.4     Other Approaches
     Thread pools, OpenMP, and Grand Central Dispatch are just a few of many
     emerging technologies for managing multithreaded applications. Other com-
     mercial approaches include parallel and concurrent libraries, such as Intel's
     Threading Building Blocks (TBB) and several products from Microsoft. The Java
     language and API have seen significant movement toward supporting concur-
     rent programming as well. A notable example is the java.util.concurrent
     package, which supports implicit thread creation and management.
