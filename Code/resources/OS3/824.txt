Memory Management
      Memory management under Linux has two components. The first deals with
      allocating and freeing physical memory--pages, groups of pages, and small
      blocks of RAM. The second handles virtual memory, which is memory-mapped
      into the address space of running processes. In this section, we describe these
      two components and then examine the mechanisms by which the loadable
      components of a new program are brought into a process's virtual memory in
      response to an exec() system call.
