Communication Protocols
      When we are designing a communication network, we must deal with the
      inherent complexity of coordinating asynchronous operations communicating
      in a potentially slow and error-prone environment. In addition, the systems on
      the network must agree on a protocol or a set of protocols for determining
      host names, locating hosts on the network, establishing connections, and
      so on. We can simplify the design problem (and related implementation)
      by partitioning the problem into multiple layers. Each layer on one system
      communicates with the equivalent layer on other systems. Typically, each layer
      has its own protocols, and communication takes place between peer layers
      using a specific protocol. The protocols may be implemented in hardware or
      software. For instance, Figure 17.5 shows the logical communications between
      two computers, with the three lowest-level layers implemented in hardware.
      The  International           Standards    Organization         created  the     OSI  model  for
      describing the various layers of networking. While these layers are not imple-
      mented in practice, they are useful for understanding how networking logically
      works, and we describe them below:
                   computer A                                             computer B
                          AP                                                  AP
                   application layer                                      A-L (7)
                   presentation layer                                     P-L (6)
                   session layer                                          S-L (5)
                   transport layer                                        T-L (4)
                   network layer                                          N-L (3)
                   link layer                                             L-L (2)
                   physical layer                                         P-L (1)
                                                data network
                                           network environment
