      and DVD-ROM drives. Alternatively, the disk rotation speed can stay constant;
      in this case, the density of bits decreases from inner tracks to outer tracks to
      keep the data rate constant. This method is used in hard disks and is known as
      constant angular velocity (CAV).
      The number of sectors per track has been increasing as disk technology
      improves, and the outer zone of a disk usually has several hundred sectors per
      track. Similarly, the number of cylinders per disk has been increasing; large
      disks have tens of thousands of cylinders.
