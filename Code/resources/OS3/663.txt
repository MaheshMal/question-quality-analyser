Access Control
      Since access is checked when the file is opened, protection is ensured. This
      strategy is used in the UNIX system.
      The right to access must still be checked on each access, and the file-table
      entry has a capability only for the allowed operations. If a file is opened for
      reading, then a capability for read access is placed in the file-table entry. If
      an attempt is made to write onto the file, the system identifies this protection
      violation by comparing the requested operation with the capability in the
      file-table entry.
