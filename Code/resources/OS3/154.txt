Examples of IPC Systems
     In this section, we explore three different IPC systems. We first cover the POSIX
     API for shared memory and then discuss message passing in the Mach operating
     system. We conclude with Windows, which interestingly uses shared memory
     as a mechanism for providing certain types of message passing.
     3.5.1  An Example: POSIX Shared Memory
     Several IPC mechanisms are available for POSIX systems, including shared
     memory and message passing. Here, we explore the POSIX API for shared
     memory.
        POSIX shared memory is organized using memory-mapped files, which
     associate the region of shared memory with a file. A process must first create
                message next consumed;
                while (true) {
                   receive(next consumed);
                   /*      consume  the  item      in  next  consumed  */
                }
                   Figure 3.16  The consumer process using message passing.
