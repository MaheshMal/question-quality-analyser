                          Figure 5.14      The structure of philosopher i.
     where all the elements of chopstick are initialized to 1. The structure of
     philosopher i is shown in Figure 5.14.
        Although    this  solution      guarantees  that  no   two  neighbors  are    eating
     simultaneously, it nevertheless must be rejected because it could create a
     deadlock. Suppose that all five philosophers become hungry at the same time
     and each grabs her left chopstick. All the elements of chopstick will now be
     equal to 0. When each philosopher tries to grab her right chopstick, she will be
     delayed forever.
        Several possible remedies to the deadlock problem are replaced by:
     ·  Allow at most four philosophers to be sitting simultaneously at the table.
     ·  Allow a philosopher to pick up her chopsticks only if both chopsticks are
        available (to do this, she must pick them up in a critical section).
     ·  Use an asymmetric solution--that is, an odd-numbered philosopher picks
        up first her left chopstick and then her right chopstick, whereas an even-
        numbered philosopher picks up her right chopstick and then her left
        chopstick.
        In Section 5.8, we present a solution to the dining-philosophers problem
     that ensures freedom from deadlocks. Note, however, that any satisfactory
     solution to the dining-philosophers problem must guard against the possibility
     that one of the philosophers will starve to death. A deadlock-free solution does
     not necessarily eliminate the possibility of starvation.
