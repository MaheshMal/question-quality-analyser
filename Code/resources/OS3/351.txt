Deadlock Avoidance
     void transaction(Account from,        Account       to,         double  amount)
     {
        mutex  lock1,  lock2;
        lock1  =  get  lock(from);
        lock2  =  get  lock(to);
        acquire(lock1);
        acquire(lock2);
               withdraw(from, amount);
               deposit(to,       amount);
        release(lock2);
        release(lock1);
     }
                  Figure 7.5     Deadlock example with lock ordering.
     Deadlock is possible if two threads simultaneously invoke the transaction()
     function, transposing different accounts. That is, one thread might invoke
     transaction(checking        account,  savings account,            25);
     and another might invoke
     transaction(savings account,          checking account,           50);
     We leave it as an exercise for students to fix this situation.
