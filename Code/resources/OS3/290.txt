Scheduling Algorithms
     CPU scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the processes in the
     ready queue is to be allocated the CPU. There are many different CPU-scheduling
     algorithms. In this section, we describe several of them.
     6.3.1  First-Come, First-Served Scheduling
     By far the simplest CPU-scheduling algorithm is the first-come, first-served
     (FCFS) scheduling algorithm. With this scheme, the process that requests the
     CPU first is allocated the CPU first. The implementation of the FCFS policy is
     easily managed with a FIFO queue. When a process enters the ready queue, its
     PCB is linked onto the tail of the queue. When the CPU is free, it is allocated to
     the process at the head of the queue. The running process is then removed from
     the queue. The code for FCFS scheduling is simple to write and understand.
          On the negative side, the average waiting time under the FCFS policy is
     often quite long. Consider the following set of processes that arrive at time 0,
     with the length of the CPU burst given in milliseconds:
                                 Process   Burst Time
                                       P1         24
                                       P2         3
                                       P3         3
