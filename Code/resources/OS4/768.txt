Byzantine Faults and Agreement Protocols
Because of the difficulty in undoing wrong actions, recovery from Byzantine faults
has been studied only in the restricted context of agreement between processes.
The agreement problem is motivated by the Byzantine generals problem where a
group of generals have to decide whether to attack the enemy. The generals and
their armies are located in different geographical locations, hence generals have
to depend on exchange of messages to arrive at a decision. Possible faults are
that messages may get lost, or some generals may be traitors who deliberately
send out confusing messages. An agreement protocol is designed to arrive at an
agreement in spite of such faults.
Three agreement problems have been defined in literature. In the Byzantine
agreement problem one process starts the agreement protocol by broadcasting a
single value to all other processes. A process that receives the value broadcasts it to
other processes. A nonfaulty process broadcasts the same value that it receives.
A faulty process may broadcast an arbitrary value; it may even send different
values to different processes. Processes may have to perform many rounds of
