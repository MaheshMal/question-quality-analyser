Features of Distributed Systems
A distributed system can consist of two or more computer systems, each with
its own clock and memory, some networking hardware, and a capability of
                                                                                            653

             Feature                                 Description
             Resource sharing                        An application may use resources located in different
                                                     computer systems.
             Reliability                             A distributed system provides availability, i.e.,
                                                     continuity of services, despite occurrence of faults. It is
                                                     achieved through redundancies in the network and
                                                     resources, and in OS services.
             Computation speedup                     Parts of a computation can be executed in parallel in
                                                     different computer systems, thus reducing duration of
                                                     an application, i.e., its running time.
             Communication                           Users or their subcomputations located at different
                                                     nodes can communicate reliably by using OS services.
             Incremental growth                      Open system standards permit new subsystems to be
                                                     added to a distributed system without having to replace
                                                     or upgrade existing subsystems. This way, the cost of
                                                     enhancing a capability of a distributed system is
                                                     proportional to the additional capability desired.
             performing some of the control functions of the OS (see Definition 3.8). Benefits
             of a distributed system were discussed earlier in Section 3.8; these are summarized
             here in Table 16.1.
                Use of distributed systems spread rapidly in 1990s when computer hardware
             prices  dropped   and          use  of  the  open    system    standard  facilitated       incremen-
             tal growth of a system. An open system has well-defined and nonproprietary
             interfaces with its own components and with other systems. These interfaces
             are typically developed or approved by a standards body, so they have ready
             acceptance within the computer industry. Their use enables addition of new com-
             ponents and subsystems to a computer system, thereby facilitating incremental
             growth. The LAN is an excellent example of an open system. Computer systems
             ranging from supercomputers to cheap PCs can be connected to it because they
             all use a standard interface. When a distributed system is implemented by using
             a LAN, its computing capability can be enhanced incrementally by connecting
             new computer systems to the LAN.
                The benefits of distributed systems listed in Table 16.1 are realized using the
             following hardware and software components:
             ·  Hardware components: Individual computer systems and networking hard-
                ware such as cables, links, and routers.
             ·  Software components: Operating system components that handle creation
                and scheduling of distributed computations and use of distant resources,
                OS    and  programming               language     features  that     support  writing     of      dis-
                tributed   computations,             and  networking    software,    which    ensures     reliable
                communication.
