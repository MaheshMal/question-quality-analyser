States and Events in a Distributed System
             17.2.1 Local and Global States
             Each entity in a system has its own state. The state of a memory cell is the value
             contained in it. The state of a CPU is the contents of its PSW and general-purpose
             registers. The state of a process is its state tag; state of the memory allocated to it;
             the CPU state if it is currently scheduled on the CPU, or contents of PCB fields if
             it is not scheduled on the CPU; and the state of its interprocess communication,
             which consists of information concerning the messages received and sent by it.
             The state of an entity is called a local state. The global state of a system at time
             instant t is the collection of local states of all entities in it at time t.
             We denote the local state of a process Pk at time t as skt , where the subscript
             is omitted if the identity of the process is implicit in the context. We denote the
             global state of a system at time t as St. If a system contains n processes P1, . . . , Pn,
             St  {s1t , s2t , . . . , snt }.
