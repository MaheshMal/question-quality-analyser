Segmentation with Paging
In this approach, each segment in a program is paged separately. Accordingly, an
integral number of pages is allocated to each segment. This approach simplifies
memory allocation and speeds it up, and also avoids external fragmentation.
A page table is constructed for each segment, and the address of the page table is
kept in the segment's entry in the segment table. Address translation for a logical
address (si, bi) is now done in two stages. In the first stage, the entry of si is
located in the segment table, and the address of its page table is obtained. The
byte number bi is now split into a pair (psi, bpi), where psi is the page number in
