Using Idle Ram Effectively
             A workstation or laptop has a large memory because it is needed for running
             specific applications. However, memory remains idle when the applications are
             not active. Operating system designers have long pondered the issue of how idle
             memory can be exploited for the benefit of the user. A typical solution is to run
             utilities such as antivirus software during idle periods of a computer so that their
             execution does not tie up memory and consume CPU time when the computer
             is being used for productive purposes. However, even such operation of utilities
             can have a negative impact on performance because the utilities might displace
             important applications from memory, so they have to be loaded back into memory
             before they can be used.
