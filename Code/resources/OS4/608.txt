Access Methods
As mentioned in Section 13.3.4, an access method provides support for efficient
processing of a class of files that use a specific file organization. For the funda-
mental file organizations discussed in Section 13.3, the IOCS may provide access
methods for the following kinds of processing:
·  Unbuffered processing of sequential-access files
·  Buffered processing of sequential-access files
·  Processing of direct-access files
·  Unbuffered processing of index sequential-access files
·  Buffered processing of index sequential-access files
Access methods for buffered processing of sequential-access and index sequential-
access files incorporate the buffering technique illustrated in Figure 14.17(c).
These access methods also optionally perform blocking of records, using the
technique shown in Figure 14.20.
   We assume that each access method module provides three entry points with
the following parameters:
1. AM-open (<internal_id>)
2. AM-close (<internal_id>)
3. AM-read/write (<internal_id>, <record_info>, <I/O_area addr>)
