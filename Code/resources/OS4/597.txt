Disk Scheduling
             The seek time of a disk block depends on its position relative to the current posi-
             tion of the disk heads. Consequently, the total seek time involved in performing a
             set of I/O operations depends on the order in which the operations are performed.
             The throughput of a disk defined as the number of I/O operations performed per
             second, also depends on the order in which I/O operations are performed. Hence
             the physical IOCS and device drivers for disks employ a disk scheduling policy
             to perform disk I/O operations in a suitable order. We shall discuss the following
             disk scheduling policies before describing disk scheduling in modern systems:
             ·  First-come, first-served (FCFS) scheduling: Select the I/O operation that was
                requested earliest.
             ·  Shortest seek time first (SSTF) scheduling: Select the I/O operation whose
                seek time from the current position of disk heads is the shortest.
             ·  SCAN scheduling: This policy moves the disk heads from one end of the
                platter to the other, servicing I/O operations for blocks on each track or
                cylinder before moving on to the next one. It is called a scan. When the
                disk heads reach the other end of the platter, they are moved in the reverse
                direction and newly arrived requests are processed in a reverse scan. A variant
                called look scheduling reverses the direction of disk heads when no more I/O
                operations can be serviced in the current direction. It is also called the elevator
                algorithm.
             ·  Circular SCAN or CSCAN scheduling: This policy performs a scan as in
                SCAN scheduling. However, it never performs a reverse scan; instead, it
                moves the heads back to that end of the platter from where they started
                and initiates another scan. The circular look variant (we will call it C-look
                scheduling) moves the heads only as far as needed to service the last I/O
                operation in a scan before starting another scan.
             The FCFS disk scheduling policy is easy to implement but does not guarantee
             good disk throughput. To implement the shortest seek time first (SSTF) policy,
             the physical IOCS uses a model of the disk to compute the seek time of the
             disk block involved in an I/O operation given the current position of the disk
             heads. However, the SSTF policy is analogous to the shortest request next (SRN)
             scheduling policy, so while it achieves good disk throughput, it may starve some
             I/O requests. SSTF and the various scan policies can be efficiently implemented
             if the IOQs are maintained in sorted order by track number.
                Example 14.3 describes the operation of various disk scheduling policies for
             a set of five I/O operations. The look policy completes all I/O operations of this

example in the shortest amount of time. However, none of these policies is a clear
winner in practice because the pattern of disk accesses cannot be predicted.
                                                                                                          ·
Disk Scheduling Policies                                                                Example     14.3
Figure 14.16 summarizes the performance of the FCFS, SSTF, Look, and C-
Look disk scheduling policies for five I/O operations on a hypothetical disk
having 200 tracks. The requests are made at different instants of time. It is
assumed that the previous I/O operation completes when the system clock
reads 160 ms. The time required for the disk heads to move from track1
to track2 is assumed to be a linear function of the difference between their
positions:
            thm = tconst + | track1 - track2 | × tpt
where tconst is a constant, tpt is the per-track head movement time and thm
is the total head movement time. We assume the rotational latency and data
transfer times to be negligible, tconst = 0 ms and tpt = 1 ms. A practical value
of tconst is 2 ms. Also, the formula for thm is not linear in practice.
Figure 14.16 shows the following details for each decision: time at which
the decision is made, pending requests and head position at that time, the
scheduled I/O operation, and its seek time. The last column shows the total
seek time for each policy. The plots in the lower half of the figure show the
disk head movement for each policy. Note that the total seek times in different
scheduling policies vary greatly. SSTF is better than FCFS; however look has
the smallest total seek time in this example. It is better than C-Look because
it can reverse the direction of disk-head traversal after completing the I/O
operation on track 100, and service the operations on tracks 75, 40, and 12,
whereas C-Look starts a new scan with the operation on track 12.
                                                                                     ·
Scheduling in the disk itself can surpass scheduling in the physical IOCS
because the disk uses a more precise model that considers the seek time as well
as the rotational latency of a disk block. Hence it can make fine distinctions
between two I/O commands that would appear equivalent to the physical IOCS.
As an example, consider I/O commands that concern disk blocks that are +n
and -n tracks away from the current position of the disk heads. Both commands
have equal seek times; the physical IOCS would have to make a random choice
between them. However, given the current rotational position of the platters and
the position of the required disk block or sector, the disk may find that the block
that is +n tracks away may already be passing under the heads by the time the
heads are positioned on that track. It would mean that the disk block can be read
only in the next revolution of the disk. The disk block that is -n tracks away, on
the other hand, might pass under the heads sometime after the heads have been
positioned on that track. Hence its rotational latency would be smaller than that
of the disk block that is +n tracks away. Such finer distinctions can contribute to
higher throughput of the disk.
