Mounting of File Systems
There can be many file systems in an operating system. Each file system is con-
stituted on a logical disk, i.e., on a partition of a disk. Files contained in a file

                   system can be accessed only when the file system is mounted. The mount oper-
                   ation is what "connects" the file system to the system's directory structure. An
                   unmount operation disconnects a file system. The mount and unmount opera-
                   tions are performed by the system administrator. These operations provide an
                   element of protection to files in a file system.
                      Mounting creates an effect analogous to that provided by a link. The dif-
                   ference is that mounting does not permanently alter the directory structure. Its
                   effect lasts only until the file system is unmounted or until the system is booted
                   again. Mounting of file systems is useful when there are multiple file systems in
                   the OS (see Section 13.14.1), or when a user of a distributed system wishes to
                   access files located in a remote machine (see Chapter 20).
                      A mount point is a directory in which a file system can be mounted. A
                   mount operation is performed by issuing the command mount (<FS_name>,
                   <mount_point_name>), where <FS_name> and <mount_point_name>, both of
                   which are path names, designate the root of the file system to be mounted and the
                   mount point, respectively. When the mount operation is performed, the root of
                   the mounted file system assumes the name <mount_point_name>. Thus, any file
                   with the relative path name api in the directory <FS_name> can be accessed by
                   the path name <mount_point_name>/api. If a file system is mounted in a direc-
                   tory that already contains some files, these files become invisible to the user until
                   the file system is unmounted. The next example illustrates the effect of executing
                   a mount command.

     Example 13.6  Mounting of a File System
                   In Figure 13.11(a), ~A/admin is a mount point in a directory structure, and
                   meeting is the root directory of another file system. Figure 13.11(b) shows
                   the effect of the command mount     (meeting,~A/admin). File items can
                   now be accessed as ~A/admin/agenda/items.
