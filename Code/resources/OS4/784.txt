Transparency
In a conventional file system, a user identifies a file through a path name. He is
aware that the file belongs in a specific directory; however, he is not aware of its
location in the system. The location info field of the file's directory entry indicates
the file's location on disk. This arrangement would be adequate to provide location
transparency in a DFS as well--a user would use a path name to access a file, and
the DFS would obtain the location of the file from its directory entry. The DFS
may choose to keep all files of a directory in the same node of the distributed
system, or disperse them to different nodes. In the former case, its metadata
would be identical with that of a conventional file system. In the latter case, the
location info field of the directory entry of a file would contain a pair (node id,
location).
Providing location independence would require the information in the location
info field of a directory entry to change dynamically. Now, the DFS could change
the location of a file at will, so long as it puts information about the new location in
the location info field of the directory entry. It should similarly change information
in all links to the file (see Section 13.4.2). To simplify these changes, a DFS may
use the following arrangement: Each file is assigned a globally unique file id.
The directory entry of the file contains this file id. DFS maintains a separate
data structure to hold (file id, file location) pairs. This way, the DFS needs to
change only one pair in this data structure when the location of a file is changed,
irrespective of the number of links to the file.
