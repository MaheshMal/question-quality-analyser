What is Process Synchronization?
In this chapter, we use the term process as a generic term for both a process and a
thread. Applications employ concurrent processes either to achieve computation
speedup (see Table 5.2), or to simplify their own design, as in multithreaded
servers (see Section 5.3). As summarized in Table 5.7, processes of an application
interact among themselves to share data, coordinate their activities, and exchange
messages or signals. We use the following notation to formally define the term
interacting processes:
     read_seti   set of data items read by process Pi and interprocess messages
                 or signals received by it
     write_seti  set of data items modified by process Pi and interprocess
                 messages or signals sent by it
                                                                                                165
