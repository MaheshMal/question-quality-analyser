Operation of an OS
       When a computer is switched on, the boot procedure analyzes its configuration--
       CPU type, memory size, I/O devices, and details of other hardware connected
       to the computer (see Section 1.3). It then loads a part of the OS in memory,
       initializes its data structures with this information, and hands over control of the
       computer system to it.
            Figure 4.1 is a schematic diagram of OS operation (see Section 2.3). An
       event like I/O completion or end of a time slice causes an interrupt. When a
       process makes a system call, e.g., to request resources or start an I/O oper-
       ation, it too leads to an interrupt called a software interrupt. The interrupt

Function                         Description
Process management               Initiation and termination of processes, scheduling
Memory management                Allocation and deallocation of memory, swapping,
                                 virtual memory management
I/O management                   I/O interrupt servicing, initiation of I/O operations,
                                 optimization of I/O device performance
File management                  Creation, storage and access of files
Security and protection          Preventing interference with processes and resources
Network management               Sending and receiving of data over the network
action switches the CPU to an interrupt servicing routine. The interrupt servicing
routine performs a context save action to save information about the inter-
rupted program and activates an event handler, which takes appropriate actions
to handle the event. The scheduler then selects a process and switches the CPU
to it. CPU switching occurs twice during the processing of an event--first to
the kernel to perform event handling and then to the process selected by the
scheduler.
The functions of an OS are thus implemented by event handlers when they are
activated by interrupt servicing routines. Table 4.1 summarizes these functions,
which primarily concern management of processes and resources, and prevention
of interference with them.
