Overview of I/O Organization
Section 2.2.4 contained an overview of I/O organization. Three modes of per-
forming I/O operations--programmed mode, interrupt mode, and direct memory
access (DMA) mode--were summarized in Table 2.1. We focus on the DMA
mode of I/O operations. Figure 2.1 showed how I/O devices are connected to
device controllers, which are in turn connected to the DMA controller. Each
device controller has a unique numeric id. Similarly, each device connected

                   to it has a unique numeric device id. A device address is a pair of the form
                   (controller_id, device_id).
                          An I/O operation involves the following details:
                      ·   Operation to be performed--read, write, etc.
                      ·   Address of the I/O device.
                      ·   Number of bytes of data to be transferred.
                      ·   Addresses of areas in memory and on the I/O       device that are to participate
                          in the data transfer.
                          When an I/O operation is performed in the DMA mode, the CPU initiates
                   the I/O operation, but it is not involved in data transfer between an I/O device
                   and memory. To facilitate this mode of I/O, an I/O operation is initiated by
                   executing an I/O instruction. The CPU, the DMA controller, the device controller,
                   and the I/O device participate to realize an I/O instruction. The I/O instruction
                   points to a set of I/O commands that specify the individual tasks involved in
                   the data transfer. Implementation of an I/O command requires participation of
                   the DMA controller, the device controller, and the I/O device, but does not require
                   participation of the CPU. This way, the CPU is free to execute other instructions
                   while the I/O operation is in progress.
                          Typically, I/O commands are stored in memory and the address of the
                   memory area containing I/O commands is used as an operand in the I/O instruc-
                   tion (in some computers, the address is picked up from a standard memory
                   location when the I/O instruction is executed). When the I/O instruction is
                   executed, the CPU passes this address to the DMA controller. The DMA con-
                   troller now realizes the I/O commands. The next example provides details of this
                   arrangement.

     Example 14.1  I/O Operations
                   The I/O operation to read the data recorded in a disk block with the id (track_id,
                   block_id) is performed by executing the following I/O instruction:
                                 I/O-init (controller_id, device_id), I/O_command_addr
                   where I/O_command_addr is the start address of the memory area containing
                   the following two I/O commands:
                      1.  Position disk heads on track track_id
                      2.  Read  record  record_id     into  the  memory  area  with  the  start  address
                          memory_addr
                   ·
                          The arrangement called third party DMA works as follows: Device con-
                   trollers are connected to the DMA controller as shown in Figure 2.1. When
                   an I/O instruction is executed, the DMA controller passes details of the I/O
                   commands to the device controller of the I/O device. The device delivers the
