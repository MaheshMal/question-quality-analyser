Unified Disk Cache
Apart from disk or file caches, the OS also maintains, implicitly or explicitly,
another cache called the page cache in the virtual memory handler. Use of several
caches may increase the number of copy operations that have to be performed
to access data stored on a disk. The time and memory overhead introduced by
multiple copy operations motivates use of a unified disk cache.
     Figure 14.24(a) is a schematic diagram showing use of the disk cache and the
page cache. The page cache contains all code and data pages of processes that
are presently in memory, including pages of any memory-mapped files. A new
page is loaded into the page cache when a page fault occurs. Since the page size
is typically a few disk blocks, this operation involves reading a few blocks from
a program file or a swap file. This is file I/O. Hence the disk blocks get read into
the disk cache, and they have to be copied into the page cache. When a modified
page is to be removed from memory, it is first copied into the disk cache. From
there, it is written to the disk sometime in the future. Thus, two copy operations
are  involved   in  each  page-in  and         page-out  operation--one     copy  operation
between a disk and the disk cache, and another between the disk cache and the
