Segmentation
                  A segment is a logical entity in a program, e.g., a function, a data structure, or an
                  object. Hence it is meaningful to manage it as a unit--load it into memory for
                  execution or share it with other programs. In the logical view, a process consists
                  of a collection of segments. In the physical view, segments of a process exist in
                  nonadjacent areas of memory.
                        A process Q consists of five logical entities with the symbolic names main,
                  database, search, update, and stack. While coding the program, the pro-
                  grammer declares these five as segments in Q. This information is used by the
                  compiler or assembler to generate logical addresses while translating the program.
                  Each logical address used in Q has the form (si, bi) where si and bi are the ids of a
                  segment and a byte within a segment. For example, the instruction correspond-
                  ing to a statement call     get_sample, where get_sample is a procedure in
