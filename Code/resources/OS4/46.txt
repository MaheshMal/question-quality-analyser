Fundamental Principles of OS Operation
Before we discuss features of operating systems in Chapter 3, and their design in
later chapters, it is important to have a functional understanding of the operation
of an OS--what features of a modern computer system are important from the
OS viewpoint, how the OS uses these features during its operation to control user
programs and resources and implement security and protection, and how user
programs obtain services from the OS.
     As discussed in Section 1.1, the kernel of the operating system is the collec-
tion of routines that form the core of the operating system. It controls operation
of the computer by implementing the tasks discussed in Section 1.3, hence we
                                                                                              25
