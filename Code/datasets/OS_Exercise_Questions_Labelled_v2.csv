"Maximum urgency first (MUF) is a real-time scheduling algorithm for periodic tasks. Each task is assigned an urgency that is defined as a combination of two fixed priorities and one dynamic priority. One of the fixed priorities, the criticality, has precedence over the dynamic priority. Meanwhile, the dynamic priority has precedence over the other fixed priority, called the user priority. The dynamic priority is inversely proportional to the laxity of a task. MUF can be explained as follows. First, tasks are ordered from shortest to longest period. Define the critical task set as the first N tasks such that worst-case processor utilization does not exceed 100%. Among critical set tasks that are ready, the scheduler selects the task with the least laxity. If no critical set tasks are ready, the schedule chooses among the noncritical tasks the one with the least laxity. Ties are broken through an optional user priority and then by FCFS. Repeat Problem 10.3d, adding MUF to the diagrams. Assume that user-defined priorities are A highest, B next, C lowest. Comment on the results.",,Analyse,,,,

"The OS/390 mainframe operating system is structured around the concepts of address space and task. Roughly speaking, a single address space corresponds to a single application and corresponds more or less to a process in other operating systems. Within an address space, a number of tasks may be generated and execute concurrently; this corresponds roughly to the concept of multithreading. Two data structures are key to managing this task structure. An address space control block (ASCB) contains information about an address space needed by OS/390 whether or not that address space is executing. Information in the ASCB includes dispatching priority, real and virtual memory allocated to this address space, the number of ready tasks in this address space, and whether each is swapped out. A task control block (TCB) represents a user program in execution. It contains information needed for managing a task within an address space, including processor status information, pointers to programs that are part of this task, and task execution state. ASCBs are global structures maintained in system memory, while TCBs are local structures maintained within their address space.

"The VAX/VMS operating system makes use of four processor access modes to facilitate the protection and sharing of system resources among processes. The access mode determines â€¢ Instruction execution privileges: What instructions the processor may execute â€¢ Memory access privileges: Which locations in virtual memory the current instruction may access. The four modes are as follows: â€¢ Kernel: Executes the kernel of the VMS operating system, which includes memory management, interrupt handling, and I/O operations â€¢ Executive: Executes many of the OS service calls, including file and record (disk and tape) management routines â€¢ Supervisor: Executes other OS services, such as responses to user commands â€¢ User: Executes user programs, plus utilities such as compilers, editors, linkers, and debuggers. A process executing in a less-privileged mode often needs to call a procedure that executes in a more-privileged mode; for example, a user program requires an operating system service. This call is achieved by using a change-mode (CHM) instruction, which causes an interrupt that transfers control to a routine at the new access mode. A return is made by executing the REI (return from exception or interrupt) instruction. A number of operating systems have two modes, kernel and user.

The algorithm is referred to as selfish round robin, because the jobs in service try (in vain) to monopolize the processor by increasing their priority continuously. Use Figure 9.19 to show that the mean response time Rx for a job of service time x is given by:  where Rx  s +x-s 1 - r 1 - r r ls r assuming that arrival and service times are exponentially distributed with means 1/  and s, respectively.

"OS/2 is an obsolete OS for PCs from IBM. In OS/2, what is commonly embodied in the concept of process in other operating systems is split into three separate types of entities: session, processes, and threads. A session is a collection of one or more processes associated with a user interface (keyboard, display, and mouse). The session represents an interactive user application, such as a word processing program or a spreadsheet. This concept allows the personal-computer user to open more than one application, giving each one or more windows on the screen. The OS must keep track of which window, and therefore which session, is active, so that keyboard and mouse input are routed to the appropriate session. At any time, one session is in foreground mode, with other sessions in background mode. When a session is in foreground mode, a process performing video output sends it directly to the hardware video buffer and thence to the userâ€™s screen. When the session is moved to the background, the hardware video buffer is saved to a logical video buffer for that session. While a session is in background, if any of the threads of any of the processes of that session executes and produces screen output, that output is directed to the logical video buffer. When the session returns to foreground, the screen is updated to reflect the current contents of the logical video buffer for the new foreground session. There is a way to reduce the number of process-related concepts in OS/2 from three to two. Eliminate sessions, and associate the user interface (keyboard, mouse, and screen) with processes. Thus, one process at a time is in foreground mode. For further structuring, processes can be broken up into threads. a. What benefits are lost with this approach? b.

In 1979, J. M. Morris refuted this conjecture by publishing an algorithm using three weak semaphores. The behavior of the algorithm can be described as follows: If one or several process are waiting in a semWait(S) operation and another process is executing semSignal(S), the value of the semaphore S is not modified and one of the waiting processes is unblocked independently of semWait(S). Apart from the three semaphores, the algorithm uses two nonnegative integer variables as counters of the number of processes in certain sections of the algorithm. Thus, semaphores A and B are initialized to 1, while semaphore M and counters NA and NM are initialized to 0. The mutual exclusion semaphore B protects access to the shared variable NA. A process attempting to enter its critical section must cross two barriers represented by semaphores A and M. Counters NA and NM, respectively, contain the number of processes ready to cross barrier A and those having already crossed barrier A but not yet barrier M. In the second part of the protocol, the NM processes blocked at M will enter their critical sections one by one, using a cascade technique similar to that used in the first part.

"Suppose that we have a multiprogrammed computer in which each job has identical characteristics. In one computation period, T, for a job, half the time is spent in I/O and the other half in processor activity. Each job runs for a total of N periods. Assume that a simple round-robin scheduling is used, and that I/O operations can overlap with processor operation. Define the following quantities: â€¢ Turnaround time = actual time to complete a job â€¢ Throughput = average number of jobs completed per time period T â€¢ Processor utilization = percentage of time that the processor is active (not waiting) Compute these quantities for one, two, and four simultaneous jobs, assuming that the period T is distributed in each of the following ways: a. I/O first half, processor second half b. I/O first and fourth quarters, processor second and third quarter",,Apply,,,,

"Consider a computer system that contains an I/O module controlling a simple keyboard/printer Teletype. The following registers are contained in the CPU and connected directly to the system bus: Input Register(8), Output Register(8), Input Flag(1), Output Flag(1), and Interrupt Enable(1). The Teletype is able to encode an alphanumeric symbol to an 8-bit word and decode an 8-bit word into an alphanumeric symbol. The Input flag is set when an 8-bit word enters the input register from the Teletype. The Output flag is set when a word is printed. Describe how the CPU, using the first four registers listed in this problem, can achieve I/O with the Teletype. Describe how the function can be performed more efficiently by also employing IEN.",,Create,,,,

"During the course of execution of a program, the processor will increment the contents of the instruction register (program counter) by one word after each instruction fetch, but will alter the contents of that register if it encounters a branch or call instruction that causes execution to continue elsewhere in the program. Now consider Figure 7.8. There are two alternatives with respect to instruction addresses: â€¢ Maintain a relative address in the instruction register and do the dynamic address translation using the instruction register as input. When a successful branch or call is encountered, the relative address generated by that branch or call is loaded into the instruction register. â€¢ Maintain an absolute address in the instruction register. When a successful branch or call is encountered, dynamic address translation is employed, with the results stored in the instruction register. Which approach is preferable?",,Apply,,,,

"Consider the following ways of handling deadlock: (1) bankerâ€™s algorithm, (2) detect deadlock and kill thread, releasing all resources, (3) reserve all resources in advance, (4) restart thread and release all resources if thread needs to wait, (5) resource ordering, and (6) detect deadlock and roll back threadâ€™s actions. Another criterion is efficiency; in other words, which requires the least processor overhead. Rank order the approaches from 1 to 6, with 1 being the most efficient, assuming that deadlock is a very rare event. Comment on your ordering. Does your ordering change if deadlocks occur frequently?",,Evaluate,,,,
