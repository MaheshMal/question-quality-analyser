Roughly speaking, a single address space corresponds to a single application and corresponds more or less to a process in other operating systems. Within an address space, a number of tasks may be generated and execute concurrently; this corresponds roughly to the concept of multithreading. Two data structures are key to managing this task structure. An address space control block (ASCB) contains information about an address space needed by OS/390 whether or not that address space is executing. Information in the ASCB includes dispatching priority, real and virtual memory allocated to this address space, the number of ready tasks in this address space, and whether each is swapped out. A task control block (TCB) represents a user program in execution. It contains information needed for managing a task within an address space, including processor status information, pointers to programs that are part of this task, and task execution state.

"The VAX/VMS operating system makes use of four processor access modes to facilitate the protection and sharing of system resources among processes. The access mode determines â€¢ Instruction execution privileges: What instructions the processor may execute â€¢ Memory access privileges: Which locations in virtual memory the current instruction may access. The four modes are as follows: â€¢ Kernel: Executes the kernel of the VMS operating system, which includes memory management, interrupt handling, and I/O operations â€¢ Executive: Executes many of the OS service calls, including file and record (disk and tape) management routines â€¢ Supervisor: Executes other OS services, such as responses to user commands â€¢ User: Executes user programs, plus utilities such as compilers, editors, linkers, and debuggers. A process executing in a less-privileged mode often needs to call a procedure that executes in a more-privileged mode; for example, a user program requires an operating system service. This call is achieved by using a change-mode (CHM) instruction, which causes an interrupt that transfers control to a routine at the new access mode. A return is made by executing the REI (return from exception or interrupt) instruction. A number of operating systems have two modes, kernel and user.

"In 1978, Dijkstra put forward the conjecture that there was no solution to the mutual exclusion problem avoiding starvation, applicable to an unknown but finite number of processes, using a finite number of weak semaphores. In 1979, J. M. Morris refuted this conjecture by publishing an algorithm using three weak semaphores. The behavior of the algorithm can be described as follows: If one or several process are waiting in a semWait(S) operation and another process is executing semSignal(S), the value of the semaphore S is not modified and one of the waiting processes is unblocked independently of semWait(S). Apart from the three semaphores, the algorithm uses two nonnegative integer variables as counters of the number of processes in certain sections of the algorithm. Thus, semaphores A and B are initialized to 1, while semaphore M and counters NA and NM are initialized to 0. The mutual exclusion semaphore B protects access to the shared variable NA. A process attempting to enter its critical section must cross two barriers represented by semaphores A and M. Counters NA and NM, respectively, contain the number of processes ready to cross barrier A and those having already crossed barrier A but not yet barrier M. In the second part of the protocol, the NM processes blocked at M will enter their critical sections one by one, using a cascade technique similar to that used in the first part. Define an algorithm that conforms to this description.",,Create,,,,

"OS/2 is an obsolete OS for PCs from IBM. In OS/2, what is commonly embodied in the concept of process in other operating systems is split into three separate types of entities: session, processes, and threads. A session is a collection of one or more processes associated with a user interface (keyboard, display, and mouse). The session represents an interactive user application, such as a word processing program or a spreadsheet. This concept allows the personal-computer user to open more than one application, giving each one or more windows on the screen. The OS must keep track of which window, and therefore which session, is active, so that keyboard and mouse input are routed to the appropriate session. At any time, one session is in foreground mode, with other sessions in background mode. When a session is in foreground mode, a process performing video output sends it directly to the hardware video buffer and thence to the userâ€™s screen. When the session is moved to the background, the hardware video buffer is saved to a logical video buffer for that session. While a session is in background, if any of the threads of any of the processes of that session executes and produces screen output, that output is directed to the logical video buffer. When the session returns to foreground, the screen is updated to reflect the current contents of the logical video buffer for the new foreground session. There is a way to reduce the number of process-related concepts in OS/2 from three to two. Eliminate sessions, and associate the user interface (keyboard, mouse, and screen) with processes. Thus, one process at a time is in foreground mode. For further structuring, processes can be broken up into threads. a. What benefits are lost with this approach? b. If you go ahead with this modification, where do you assign resources (memory, files, etc.): at the process or thread level?",,Evaluate,,,,

"Maximum urgency first (MUF) is a real-time scheduling algorithm for periodic tasks. Each task is assigned an urgency that is defined as a combination of two fixed priorities and one dynamic priority. One of the fixed priorities, the criticality, has precedence over the dynamic priority. Meanwhile, the dynamic priority has precedence over the other fixed priority, called the user priority. The dynamic priority is inversely proportional to the laxity of a task. MUF can be explained as follows. First, tasks are ordered from shortest to longest period. Define the critical task set as the first N tasks such that worst-case processor utilization does not exceed 100%. Among critical set tasks that are ready, the scheduler selects the task with the least laxity. If no critical set tasks are ready, the schedule chooses among the noncritical tasks the one with the least laxity. Ties are broken through an optional user priority and then by FCFS.

This problem concerns one example of SRM activity. Real memory is divided into equal-sized blocks called frames, of which there may be many thousands. Each frame can hold a block of virtual memory referred to as a page. SRM receives control approximately 20 times per second and inspects each and every page frame. If the page has not been referenced or changed, a counter is incremented by 1. Over time, SRM averages these numbers to determine the average number of seconds that a page frame in the system goes untouched.
