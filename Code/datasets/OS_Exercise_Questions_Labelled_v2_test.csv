The four modes are as follows: â€¢ Kernel: Executes the kernel of the VMS operating system, which includes memory management, interrupt handling, and I/O operations â€¢ Executive: Executes many of the OS service calls, including file and record (disk and tape) management routines â€¢ Supervisor: Executes other OS services, such as responses to user commands â€¢ User: Executes user programs, plus utilities such as compilers, editors, linkers, and debuggers. A process executing in a less-privileged mode often needs to call a procedure that executes in a more-privileged mode; for example, a user program requires an operating system service.

"5.18 The following problem was once used on an exam: Jurassic Park consists of a dinosaur museum and a park for safari riding. There are m passengers and n single-passenger cars. Passengers wander around the museum for a while, then line up to take a ride in a safari car. When a car is available, it loads the one passenger it can hold and rides around the park for a random amount of time. If the n cars are all out riding passengers around, then a passenger who wants to ride waits; if a car is ready to load but there are no waiting passengers, then the car waits. Use semaphores to synchronize the m passenger processes and the n car processes. The following skeleton code was found on a scrap of paper on the floor of the exam room. Grade it for correctness. Ignore syntax and missing variable declarations. Remember that P and V correspond to semWait and semSignal. <CODE>",,Evaluate,,,,
"With reference to the device driver interface to the eCos kernel (Table 13.2), it is recommended that device drivers should use the _intsave() variants to claim and release spinlocks rather than the non-_intsave() variants. Explain why.",,Remember,,,,
"Table 3.5 lists typical elements found in a process control block for an unthreaded OS. Of these, which should belong to a thread control block and which should belong to a process control block for a multithreaded system?",,Understand,,,,

"Another placement algorithm for dynamic partitioning is referred to as worst-fit. In this case, the largest free block of memory is used for bringing in a process. Discuss the pros and cons of this method compared to first-, next-, and best-fit.",,Evaluate,,,,

"Consider the following program: <CODE> Note that the scheduler in a uniprocessor system would implement pseudo-parallel execution of these two concurrent processes by interleaving their instructions, without restriction on the order of the interleaving. Show a sequence (i.e., trace the sequence of interleavings of statements) such that the statement â€œx is 10â€ù is printed.",,Understand,,,,
