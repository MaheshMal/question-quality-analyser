Slack time, or laxity, is the amount of time between when a task would complete if it started now and its next deadline. This is the size of the available scheduling window.

If two or more tasks have the same minimum laxity value, they are serviced on a FCFS basis. Suppose a task currently has a laxity of t.

"The VAX/VMS operating system makes use of four processor access modes to facilitate the protection and sharing of system resources among processes. The access mode determines â€¢ Instruction execution privileges: What instructions the processor may execute â€¢ Memory access privileges: Which locations in virtual memory the current instruction may access. The four modes are as follows: â€¢ Kernel: Executes the kernel of the VMS operating system, which includes memory management, interrupt handling, and I/O operations â€¢ Executive: Executes many of the OS service calls, including file and record (disk and tape) management routines â€¢ Supervisor: Executes other OS services, such as responses to user commands â€¢ User: Executes user programs, plus utilities such as compilers, editors, linkers, and debuggers. A process executing in a less-privileged mode often needs to call a procedure that executes in a more-privileged mode; for example, a user program requires an operating system service. This call is achieved by using a change-mode (CHM) instruction, which causes an interrupt that transfers control to a routine at the new access mode. A return is made by executing the REI (return from exception or interrupt) instruction. Can you make a case for even more than four modes?",,Evaluate,,,,

The producer always manages to append a new element to the buffer and signal during the consumption of the previous element by the consumer. The producer is always appending to an empty buffer and the consumer is always taking the sole item in the buffer. Although the consumer never blocks on the semaphore, a large number of calls to the semaphore mechanism is made, creating considerable overhead. Construct a new program that will be more efficient under these circumstances.
