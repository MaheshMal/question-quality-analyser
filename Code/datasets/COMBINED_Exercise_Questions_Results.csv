"Prove that, among nonpreemptive scheduling algorithms, SPN provides the minimum average waiting time for a batch of jobs that arrive at the same time. Assume that the scheduler must always execute a task if one is available.",Factual,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual
"In a nonpreemptive uniprocessor system, the ready queue contains three jobs at time t immediately after the completion of a job. These jobs arrived at times t1, t2, and t3 with estimated execution times of r1, r2, and r3, respectively. Figure 9.18 shows the linear increase of their response ratios over time. Use this example to find a variant of response ratio scheduling, known as minimax response ratio scheduling, that minimizes the maximum response ratio for a given batch of jobs ignoring further arrivals. (Hint: Decide, first, which job to schedule as the last one.)",Factual,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Procedural
Prove that the minimax response ratio algorithm of the preceding problem minimizes the maximum response ratio for a given batch of jobs. (Hint: Focus attention on the job that will achieve the highest response ratio and all jobs executed before it. Consider the same subset of jobs scheduled in any other order and observe the response ratio of the job that is executed as the last one among them. Notice that this subset may now be mixed with other jobs from the total set.),Factual,Procedural,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural

"9.10 A processor is multiplexed at infinite speed among all processes present in a ready queue with no overhead. (This is an idealized model of round-robin scheduling among ready processes using time slices that are very small compared to the mean service time.) Show that for Poisson input from an infinite source with exponential service times, the mean response time Rx of a process with service time x is given by Rx = x/(1 – r). (Hint: Review the basic queueing equations in Appendix H or Chapter 20. Then consider the number of items waiting, w, in the system upon arrival of the given process.)",Factual,Conceptual,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual
"In a queueing system, new jobs must wait for a while before being served. While a job waits, its priority increases linearly with time from zero at a rate a. A job waits until its priority reaches the priority of the jobs in service; then, it begins to share the processor equally with other jobs in service using round robin while its priority continues to increase at a slower rate b. The algorithm is referred to as selfish round robin, because the jobs in service try (in vain) to monopolize the processor by increasing their priority continuously. Use Figure 9.19 to show that the mean response time Rx for a job of service time x is given by:  where Rx  s +x-s 1 - r 1 - r r ls r assuming that arrival and service times are exponentially distributed with means 1/  and s, respectively. (Hint: Consider the total system and the two subsystems separately.)",Factual,Procedural,Conceptual,Conceptual,Procedural
"Least laxity first (LLF) is a real-time scheduling algorithm for periodic tasks. Slack time, or laxity, is the amount of time between when a task would complete if it started now and its next deadline. This is the size of the available scheduling window. Laxity can be expressed as Laxity = (deadline time) - (current time) - (processor time needed) LLF selects the task with the minimum laxity to execute next. If two or more tasks have the same minimum laxity value, they are serviced on a FCFS basis. Consider a set of three periodic tasks with the execution profiles of Table 10.8a. Develop scheduling diagrams similar to those of Figure 10.4 for this set of tasks that compare rate monotonic, earliest deadline first, and LLF. Assume preemption may occur at 5-ms intervals. Comment on the results.",Factual,Factual,Factual,Conceptual,Procedural
"Maximum urgency first (MUF) is a real-time scheduling algorithm for periodic tasks. Each task is assigned an urgency that is defined as a combination of two fixed priorities and one dynamic priority. One of the fixed priorities, the criticality, has precedence over the dynamic priority. Meanwhile, the dynamic priority has precedence over the other fixed priority, called the user priority. The dynamic priority is inversely proportional to the laxity of a task. MUF can be explained as follows. First, tasks are ordered from shortest to longest period. Define the critical task set as the first N tasks such that worst-case processor utilization does not exceed 100%. Among critical set tasks that are ready, the scheduler selects the task with the least laxity. If no critical set tasks are ready, the schedule chooses among the noncritical tasks the one with the least laxity. Ties are broken through an optional user priority and then by FCFS. Repeat Problem 10.3d, adding MUF to the diagrams. Assume that user-defined priorities are A highest, B next, C lowest. Comment on the results.",Factual,Procedural,Procedural,Conceptual,Factual
