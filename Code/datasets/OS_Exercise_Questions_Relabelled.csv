A process executing in a less-privileged mode often needs to call a procedure that executes in a more-privileged mode; for example, a user program requires an operating system service.

"OS/2 is an obsolete OS for PCs from IBM. In OS/2, what is commonly embodied in the concept of process in other operating systems is split into three separate types of entities: session, processes, and threads. A session is a collection of one or more processes associated with a user interface (keyboard, display, and mouse). The session represents an interactive user application, such as a word processing program or a spreadsheet. This concept allows the personal-computer user to open more than one application, giving each one or more windows on the screen. The OS must keep track of which window, and therefore which session, is active, so that keyboard and mouse input are routed to the appropriate session. At any time, one session is in foreground mode, with other sessions in background mode. When a session is in foreground mode, a process performing video output sends it directly to the hardware video buffer and thence to the user’s screen. When the session is moved to the background, the hardware video buffer is saved to a logical video buffer for that session. While a session is in background, if any of the threads of any of the processes of that session executes and produces screen output, that output is directed to the logical video buffer. When the session returns to foreground, the screen is updated to reflect the current contents of the logical video buffer for the new foreground session. There is a way to reduce the number of process-related concepts in OS/2 from three to two. Eliminate sessions, and associate the user interface (keyboard, mouse, and screen) with processes. Thus, one process at a time is in foreground mode. For further structuring, processes can be broken up into threads. a. What benefits are lost with this approach? b. If you go ahead with this modification, where do you assign resources (memory, files, etc.): at the process or thread level?",16,0.999612108125,0.745856292074,0.832438,4

"The OS/390 mainframe operating system is structured around the concepts of address space and task. Roughly speaking, a single address space corresponds to a single application and corresponds more or less to a process in other operating systems. Within an address space, a number of tasks may be generated and execute concurrently; this corresponds roughly to the concept of multithreading. Two data structures are key to managing this task structure. An address space control block (ASCB) contains information about an address space needed by OS/390 whether or not that address space is executing. Information in the ASCB includes dispatching priority, real and virtual memory allocated to this address space, the number of ready tasks in this address space, and whether each is swapped out. A task control block (TCB) represents a user program in execution. It contains information needed for managing a task within an address space, including processor status information, pointers to programs that are part of this task, and task execution state. ASCBs are global structures maintained in system memory, while TCBs are local structures maintained within their address space.

"It should be possible to implement general semaphores using binary semaphores. We can use the operations semWaitB and semSignalB and two binary semaphores, delay and mutex. Consider the following: <CODE> Initially, s is set to the desired semaphore value. Each semWait operation decrements s, and each semSignal operation increments s.

There is a flaw in the preceding program. Demonstrate the flaw and propose a change that will fix it. Hint: Suppose two processes each call semWait(s) when s is initially 0, and after the first has just performed semSignalB(mutex) but not performed semWaitB(delay), the second call to semWait(s) proceeds to the same point.

"In 1978, Dijkstra put forward the conjecture that there was no solution to the mutual exclusion problem avoiding starvation, applicable to an unknown but finite number of processes, using a finite number of weak semaphores. In 1979, J. M. Morris refuted this conjecture by publishing an algorithm using three weak semaphores. The behavior of the algorithm can be described as follows: If one or several process are waiting in a semWait(S) operation and another process is executing semSignal(S), the value of the semaphore S is not modified and one of the waiting processes is unblocked independently of semWait(S). Apart from the three semaphores, the algorithm uses two nonnegative integer variables as counters of the number of processes in certain sections of the algorithm. Thus, semaphores A and B are initialized to 1, while semaphore M and counters NA and NM are initialized to 0. The mutual exclusion semaphore B protects access to the shared variable NA. A process attempting to enter its critical section must cross two barriers represented by semaphores A and M. Counters NA and NM, respectively, contain the number of processes ready to cross barrier A and those having already crossed barrier A but not yet barrier M. In the second part of the protocol, the NM processes blocked at M will enter their critical sections one by one, using a cascade technique similar to that used in the first part. Define an algorithm that conforms to this description.",5,0.993238832164,0.20623103868,0.752298,5
"5.18 The following problem was once used on an exam: Jurassic Park consists of a dinosaur museum and a park for safari riding. There are m passengers and n single-passenger cars. Passengers wander around the museum for a while, then line up to take a ride in a safari car. When a car is available, it loads the one passenger it can hold and rides around the park for a random amount of time. If the n cars are all out riding passengers around, then a passenger who wants to ride waits; if a car is ready to load but there are no waiting passengers, then the car waits. Use semaphores to synchronize the m passenger processes and the n car processes. The following skeleton code was found on a scrap of paper on the floor of the exam room. Grade it for correctness.

"Consider the solution to the infinite-buffer producer/consumer problem defined in Figure 5.10.

The scenario could be: Producer: append; semSignal; produce; ... ; append; semSignal; produce; ... Consumer: consume; ... ; take; semWait; consume; ... ; take; semWait; ... The producer always manages to append a new element to the buffer and signal during the consumption of the previous element by the consumer. The producer is always appending to an empty buffer and the consumer is always taking the sole item in the buffer. Although the consumer never blocks on the semaphore, a large number of calls to the semaphore mechanism is made, creating considerable overhead.

When three elves are having their problems solved, any other elves wishing to visit Santa must wait for those elves to return.
